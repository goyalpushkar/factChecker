// For the reference servers, the commands npx and uvx directly install the files of the 
// servers to your local environment (you don't need to install them ahead of time). 
// Note for the filesystem, the . is provided as the third argument and it means 
// "current directory". This means that you're allowing for the fetch server to interact 
// with the files and directories that are within the current directory
