I'm I'm sick of multi-millionaires
telling kids who can't afford to turn
the heating on you just need to be more
entrepreneurial it's sick Dan it's sick
well your video where you talk about if
you don't have a rich dad you're screwed
well to me if I had have come across
your content at 19 20 years old I would
have been screwed my friends can't feed
their kids okay if it was that easy why
is everybody not doing it I'll tell you
why people aren't doing it it's because
you like to say one thing back on
that today's debate is fiery to say the
least but important nonetheless as I sat
down with two leading experts in wealth
and Entrepreneurship and the economy to
discuss the state of the US the state of
the UK and the Western World do you
think the reason the average Brit
American are getting poorer is because
they don't know how to create wealth no
the reason people are getting poorer is
because of big governments record levels
of taxes an outdated schooling system
technology and remote working you sure
about that how do you disagree with
those opinions living standards are
falling because of growing wealth in
equality if you allow the rich to get
richer they squeeze the middle class and
the poor class out of things like
housing let's cut tax on people who are
working hard and let's raise tax on the
richest and most powerful people in the
world that's an overly simplified view
of things we now have a th000
millionaires a month leaving which means
every ordinary person who pays 10 grand
a year in tax will now have to pay 20
grand a year in tax you end up cutting
off your nose to spite your face if we
are a country that don't try and do
things which are necessary because they
are hard then our kids will live in
poverty what do you want people to do
there's a lot of different ways Backle
up this has always blown my mind a
little bit 53% of you that listen to the
show regularly haven't yet subscribed to
the show so could I ask you for a favor

you is if you do that then I'll do
everything in my power me and my team to
make sure that this show is better for
you every single week we'll listen to
your feedback we'll find the guest that
you want me to speak to and we'll
continue to do what we do thank you so
much
Gary
Daniel Daniel you've been on the show a
few times before so I want to start with
Gary and understand a little bit about
your backstory and who you are and
having been through the trading game and
read and watched many many of your
videos over time I have a a sort of deep
understanding of that but for anyone
that doesn't know you can you give me a
picture of the context that um has
brought you to where you are today
writing about the things you're writing
about today and running the YouTube
channel and speaking to the subject
matter that you're speaking about today
take me right back and give me as much
as you possibly can okay so my name is
Gary Stevenson uh I was born in a place
called ilford which is in outer East
London quite a poor family little
Terrace House by the railway you know
playing football in the streets kind of
stuff
um always very good at maths since I was
a kid very talented Master student
eventually able to get into the London
School of Economics which is an
extremely Elite University economics
University in the center of London which
is basically a kind of investment
banking boot camp got a job as a Trader
started working full-time as a
short-term interest rates Trader at City
Bank in London in June
2008 when I was 21 obviously yeah
exactly that's just before the big
credit crash the big Leman crisis and I
watched the Leman Crisis happen in front
of my eyes I was um short-term interest
rate trading is basically like
short-term loans and during the credit
crisis what credit crisis is is nobody
can borrow any money so like short-term
loans become really really important
important my desk which was like
historically an unfashionable area of
trading became like the center of the
crisis or one of the centers of the
crisis people started making tons of
money um I was working with all these
crazy people and you can imagine me like
I turn up 21 years old and then like
within three months like everyone around
me is making a ton of money during the
credit crisis but what really interested
me was what happened after the crisis
itself which was so we're betting on
interest
rates long story short interest rates
come down when the economy is weak and
they go up when the economy is strong or
when the economy is overheating from an
inflation perspective in 2018 all the
interest rates go to zero so suddenly
our job is basically predicting and
betting on when will those interest
rates go back up which is when will the
economy recover and this is super
interesting right in
2008 because all the interest rates went
to zero so quickly like before 2008 it's
important to remember rates would move
from like five and a half to five and a
quarter and then here in 2008 everywhere
in the world slashing to zero Bo half a
percent exactly and everybody all the
economists were like wow this is going
to cause a massive recovery because they
thought that interest rates were
powerful and everybody predicted that
rates would come back up in 2009 which
of course we knowed they didn't then
everybody predicted that rates would go
up in 2010 which we now know they didn't
and then at the beginning of 2011
everybody was predicting rates would
definitely go up this year and this to
me was so interesting so interesting
because you know I studied master and
economics at one of the best economics
universities in the world and now I'm
working with these traders who are
getting paid millions of pounds a year
million pounds a year to predict the
economy to predict the interest rates
and everybody is wrong year after year
after year and this
was I was so amazing to me for a couple
of reasons first of all it's like wow
like this is a big thing that we as a
society should understand and like we're
getting it wrong but secondly
if all of the best guys in the world are
getting this wrong then if I can figure
this out I can make a ton of money here
G how much money did you make for City
Bank at the age of 24 years old that
year so that year 2011 I put this big
bet on that it would get worse forever
and I was City bank's most profitable
Trader in the world that year and I made
them just over $ 35 million you made
them $35 million you eventually decide
to leave City Bank yeah why
I mean I think that's an interesting
question right you know in the sense
that I've just explained to you what
happened which is I made a ton of money
by betting on the collapse of Western
Society uh I did it in 2011 I did it
again in 2012
um I would prefer for it not to collapse
step and I'm trying to stop it from
collapsing when you say it collapsing
what exactly you're referring to that
you you don't want to
collapse so you you born in Botswana
right yeah do you still have family
there um I've got family in Nigeria
which is where my my family are from I
was born in Botswana because we were
visiting there but got family in Africa
do you go to Nigeria much no I I've got
home in Cape Town in South Africa so I
see the it's a great place if you want
to see inequality I think there
is a naivity in in in this country in
places like the US that the kind of
inequality the kind of broad poverty
that you see in places like South Africa
in places like Nigeria in places like
India can't happen
here it will happen here that is the
future of this country that is the
future of the US and I'm not just saying
that I'm betting on it and I've been
betting on it for 15 years and I've been
right for 15 years that is what I'm
trying to avoid
Daniel where did you come from yeah so I
grew up in Australia um and I was born
to low-income family I grew up in a
place that had 24% Unemployment uh
pretty much the only jobs or
opportunities around me were things like
uh the trades building construction Pest
Control um hospitality and tourism um so
uh at 14 I got a job at McDonald's and
then I'm got a job in a bar and Pizza
Hut delivery driving and I discover
entrepreneurship so I discover books
about entrepreneurship and I discovered
that some people make millions similar
to yourself you saw Canary WF I read a
book about business ownership and as we
sit here today can you give me the
overview of your business success since
then yeah so I now have a group of
companies that I've either started or
bought um there's I've just sold a
company so there's seven companies in
the group um I've started a couple of
software companies one of our companies
is now the fastest growing one of the
fastest growing companies in the UK um
we you know we're a software business uh
I've got a couple of agencies I've got a
Education and Training business and
where when you think about the UK and
broadly the Western world today
what is your assessment of where we're
at as a country and what's concerning
you because Gary expressed quite
articulately that his big concern is
that because of wealth INE equality
we're going to end up in a similar
position to the likes of India what are
you concerned about I agree that it
wasn't that long ago that we had real
serious wealth inequality in this
country there are amazing photos from
like a 100 years ago of kids working in
mines and kids doing oyster shocking and
all this horrible work and um you know
there's a there's a book Charles Dickens
wrot wrote called The Tale of Two Cities
and the opening line of the book is it
was the best of times it was the worst
of times and I think we've actually
gotten to that point here where some
people in the UK it's the best of times
if you uh like in your situation you're
you know you're booming you're a
globally successful business um I've got
a globally successful business and then
there are a lot of people who completely
cannot relate to this their you know
Energy prices are now the most expensive
in the Western World house prices are
completely unaffordable it used to be
used to take 3 years to for a deposit
it's now 20 years if you you know
theoretically 20 years if you can save
for a deposit food prices are through
the roof so we're we're in a really diff
like for anyone who is not tapped into
digital economy fast growth and all of
that sort of stuff life is getting
harder and worse um and things are
collapsing um if you if you would um go
with that the there is a predictable
path countries go on and there's this
thing called the economic freedom index
and the economic freedom index basically
says how economically free are you how
how much access do you have to free
markets um do can you start a business
can you scale a business um does
anything inhibit your ability to run
your own life countries that have high
degrees of economic freedom have very
low poverty they have widespread
affluence and countries that have low
economic freedoms have high poverty and
it can be the difference between less
than 10% right up to 70% poverty rates
um and when countries go on a path
towards economic freedom poverty just
drops so India for examp example has
been on that path and they announced
today that they've almost eradicated uh
abject poverty or extreme poverty um the
UK went on that path of low economic
freedom to high economic freedom and we
saw poverty rates come right down but in
2008 when the global financial crisis
happened one of the things that happened
is the government said we need to step
in and we need to take charge and
everyone said please do um so they came
in and they said all right we're going
to ramp up debt ramp up taxes uh to pay
for the debt and we're also going to put
it all regul in and unfortunately that
starts to reduce economic freedom then
the pandemic happens and they say oh
we're going to spend more money again
through debt we're going to have more uh
taxes more regulations less economic
freedom so the UK we went from an 82
when I arrived in 2006 went from 82 out
of 100 down to 68 out of 100 so we're
less economically free and predictably
what we will always see happen if you
lower people's economic freedom more
poverty
uh less affluence uh the Millionaires
and the wealth creators leave uh the
people who are stuck in um dead end jobs
uh or no jobs get incredibly frustrated
everyone starts looking for someone to
blame people are angry and they're like
who do we blame and who do they blame
it's very different because in the US we
blame us blam someone different to the
UK so we have a historical cultural
memory in the UK we have a cultural
memory that the people to blame are the
rich so so uh we have landlords and uh
aristocracy and the landed gentry those
guys are to blame right so blame the
rich is what we say in the UK in the US
they have a very different view their
cultural memory is that they're
anti-government they want limited
government in 2023 there was this song
that came out called uh rich men north
of uh Richmond and it was the number one
song in America and the lyrics of the
song basically says people in Washington
do not care about working people um they
ATT taxing everything we touch you can't
earn money they depreciate the dollar um
they tax tax tax tax tax and they want
to control Our Lives those are the
lyrics of the songs controlling our
lives and taxing us so the American uh
reaction to this is who's to blame
government so we want smaller government
we want a department of government
efficiency to come in we want someone as
a wrecking ball who will come in and
smash government the British instinct is
hate the rich it must be the Rich's
fault so when we look for like all all
of the Western countries that
implemented lower economic
freedoms created more poverty less
affluence and more disruption to their
economies so both us and UK for example
and Australia as well but both sides of
the pond want someone to blame it's just
that the Americans blame government and
we blame the rich Gary I'm sure you you
have a lot to to say there I know you
both use the word collapsing so you
agree that there's a problem here but I
think you from studying both of your
sort of perspectives you think that this
the solution and the cause of the
problem is different I mean I put bets
on I put bets on I put bet that's what I
do I put bets on um at the beginning of
covid we knew the government was going
to give enormous amount of money out um
total amount of money now UK government
deficit since the beginning of Co is is1
trillion pounds US number is $4
trillion that's you know £20,000 per UK
adult
my background is I understand that when
the distribution gets worse when
inequality gets worse living standards
full so when when the UK government was
going to give a trillion pounds out all
I wanted to know was who's going to end
up with that money that's all I wanted
to know and um I mean the US number 13
trillion 14 trillion is just outlandish
but I think the most amazing thing I've
ever seen in my whole
life was that at the beginning of Co the
very beginning of Co we knew governments
across the world we're going to be
giving out tens of trillions of pounds
dollars
Euros nobody even thought to ask who's
going to get tens of trillions richer
nobody in the conservatives nobody in
labor nobody in the Republicans nobody
in Democrats nobody in the media nobody
in Academia nobody the central banks
nobody asked this it's
it's it's it's almost beautiful it's
it's unbelievable it's unbeliev so I I
sat down and I did I did the analysis at
the beginning because lockdown is
essentially Banning the spending of the
rich
and replacing that spending of the rich
with printed money from government what
happens is the government gives workers
money they use that money to pay their
bills to pay their rent pay their
mortgage it goes to the rich the rich
can't spend it because they're locked
indoors and what you get is essentially
an enormous amount of money from the
government to the poor to the rich and
this massive massive transfer of wealth
um that was obviously going that was so
obviously going to happen at the
beginning of Co nobody discussed it
which I think is itself
amazing let me ask you a question right
if we were now to pause the economy for
2 years and during that pause massively
increase wealth inequality what do you
think would happen to Broad living
conditions when we
unpaused see one of the things that I
think happened during the pandemic is
everything went digital and um
entrepreneurs and investors did actually
think about what would happen the
investors immediately boomed stocks like
zoom and uh Microsoft and we ended up
with the Magnificent 7 um I don't know
if you you know there's seven big tech
companies in the USA market and those
big seven companies have gone from five
trillion valuation to 17 TR trillion
valuation uh in the time of the pandemic
and if you think about what did the
pandemic do uh everyone had to work from
home so we all had to have Microsoft
subscriptions everyone went onto website
so we all went to AWS uh Amazon we all
started buying and learning how to buy
from Amazon rather than buying from from
our local high streets every business in
the world figured out how to run their
business remotely uh we had this massive
transformation it wasn't it was like
it's actually a wholesale transformation
of society that we all learned how to
live and work differently um I saw a
boom in entrepreneurship so what I saw
as an entrepreneur accelerator um
someone who runs an entrepreneur
accelerator is just there was this
sudden boom in people launching
businesses uh setting up Shopify
accounts setting up YouTube uh
businesses so the money really has moved
from the traditional economy the 2019
High Street economy over to the digital
economy and what we see is that the
investors know what's going on and they
just invest in This Magnificent Seven
company I think 50% of the gains of the
S&P 500 is tech companies um so all the
money just goes flooding into the the
technology companies my my belief is
that technolog is really dividing people
that essentially if you take anyone from
any background if they work in
technology uh if they're in Media Tech
Finance any of that stuff that operates
online they tend to actually do pretty
pretty well after the pandemic I ask you
a question yeah go for do you think the
average Brit American Australian whoever
the person out there is watching if they
quit their job and go work in Tech do
you think they'll be able to get
Financial Security relatively
easily depends when you defi Define
Financial Security the issue with house
prices the ability to raise a family
have a home yeah so having a home is a
big issue right so here's here's what I
here's what I see with houses cuz houses
annoy me as well my dad bought a house
for
$188,000 which is about £10,000 or less
than £10,000 and it's probably worth
over a million dollars um uh today so
something went wrong and and this by the
way is not UK specific uh the socialist
countries had house prices go through
the roof if you go to Norway or Sweden
their house prices grew by 600% uh in
then it's happening everywhere it's not
specific to anywhere it's happening
everywhere but but what happened what
what has definitely in the UK is we
actually have um a housing traffic jam
so in this country in the UK we have 9.5
million homes that have two or more
spare bedrooms big family homes have two
or more spare bedrooms and when you look
into who owns those houses 78% of
housing wealth is Baby Boomers um and
now anecdotally I take my kids
trick-or-treating at uh Halloween and we
go down a street that is big family
homes and you go knock on the doors and
it's all people over 65 right and living
in a big family home with empty spare
bedrooms we you think the average
American over 65 is living luxuriously
the average American over 65 so more
than half of the US economy is in the
hands of baby boomers right so they own
all the houses the the houses got bought
up cheap baby boomers still own those
houses to this day the big family homes
with multiple spare bedrooms are empty
um and now that creates this traffic jam
people my age my grandparents yeah they
all owned property
all four of
them died with
nothing um because that wealth which
they had in in property was was used in
equity release schemes they they it was
used in paying through their retirement
it was used in End of Life Care um do
you think when those old people die
young people today will be rich there is
half the economy held by baby burus it's
either going to be passed down or passed
into the age care industry or passed
into the but the issue of why we can't
get homes two things government
massively inflated the value of homes
through debt so they just in injected
like low interest rates that you
involved in who who is the debt to well
the debt is to anyone who can take out
Al loan because if a 0% interest rates
or 2% interest R you think it's the debt
is the ordinary families do you think
ordinary families are the creditors when
you say ordinary families you mean
bottom third so if your average British
or American family now has half a
million pounds of debt crit it's anyone
who could get their at that particular
time anyone who could get their hands on
a loan to buy a house but who has the
credit who has who is on the other side
of the debt so if the average British
family million P banking license does
the average British family have half
million pound of credit well a lot of
people have got a lot of equity in their
home now you think the average British
family is sitting on half a million
pound cash I'd love to look at the what
the actual number is but it's a couple
hundred thousand worth of equity 78 what
about the credit on the line credit on
the line owns the credit on the line in
mind it's disproportionately older
people so
think the average British old person is
sitting on million millions of pounds of
cash not millions of cash no equity well
someone is on the other side of just one
say the difference the difference is if
you inflate the value of a house you
don't have cash you have a house that's
worth a lot of money so 78% of home
ownership wealth is in the hands of
people over 65 now it's baby boomer
generation and they got a great gift
from the government which is the
government said we're going to just give
free loans away if someone previously
could have only afforded to take out a
200 Grand loan with low interest rates
they can afford a 300 Grand L do you
think it's okay that the average British
or American young person will never own
any wealth the issue is not whether it's
okay or not the issue is what do you do
about it I do you own wealth I've got
wealth yeah you own wealth but depends
what you call Wealth I do so do we three
multimillionaires do we think it's okay
that the average Brit or American young
person will never own any wealth that to
me that's because I don't think that's
okay to me that's not the debate is it
okay it's not well it it's not okay no
we want widespread would you rather that
the people who currently are
multi-millionaires would you rather that
all of the world was owned by their kids
I think that the way you see the world
as a Trader is that the world is a zero
sum game and that there's basically the
pi is a fixed pi and it gets sliced up
how fast is the growing now there's
something like this what's UK GDP growth
at the moment yeah it's not it's not
high right 1% how much did your wealth
grow in the last year uh exponentially
okay so if our weals my wealth probably
grew about 20% in the last year maybe 30
okay okay if our worlds are growing 30%
and the economy is growing at 1% where
is it coming from if it's not coming
from our viewers so I'll tell you where
my wealth comes from my wealth comes
from building technology companies and
the way it works is pretty weird which
is that I invent something out of my
head and I go to investors and I say to
the investors here's what we're going to
create and I give them a spreadsheet and
then they say we'll give you a couple
hundred grand to get started which is
called seed Capital but on paper makes
me worth a couple of million right but
there there's nothing has been taken
from anyone at this point uh the
investors have said okay we'll invest
some money then as the business succeeds
some more investors come along and they
say we'll give you a little bit more
money to keep growing it um and I'm
innovating something new and let's say
investors come in and give me a million
pounds and for 10% of the company and
the rest of the company's worth 9
million or $9 million right so I'm not
stealing something from the existing
economy I'm bringing something from
outside of the economy into the economy
um and my quote unquote net worth is
growing exponentially because investors
say we'll give you a little bit of money
that values the rest of the pie at a lot
of money but there's everyone's getting
richer in the in the wealth create
there's where there's wealth extraction
which is what Traders do they extract
from the existing economy um and they
bet on uh the economy and then there's
wealth creation which what entrepreneurs
do they come up with new ideas better
ways of doing things and they build
wealth so do you think the reason our
viewers the average Brit American are
getting poorer is because they don't
know how to create wealth no the reason
people are getting poorer is because
economic freedoms are being eroded when
we have high economic that with taxes
well anything that imp it could be
anything that impacts economic freedom
so uh taxes and regulations are big was
economic freedom higher in the 50s uh
50s was okay so 50s was a interesting
time we we were in food Russians in this
country till uh 1956 so we had 10 years
of food rations after the war um we had
a labor shortage uh because only really
men worked women hadn't entered the
workforce in Mass um there had been
three or 400,000 men killed in war so we
actually had this big labor shortage the
whole country needed to rebuild because
of the blitz had bombed it so we had
this huge need for economic activity and
not enough people to do it we only had
2% unemployment people who had had their
blown off were put to work at that
particular time so we had this boom this
postwar boom and we also had the postwar
baby boom which drove consumption uh and
then when we got to the 60s we had the
Roaring 60s or the um The Swinging 60s
right pretty amazing time in Britain and
Along Comes high taxes uh and they put
up the taxes massively at the end of the
60s um and it pretty much crashed the
economy one of the things that happened
so what were the tax rates in the 50s
well they went up as high as 80 to 90%
uh for the top for the top ear I think
it was in the 60s you sure about that I
think the 50s are unique what is the
answer feel like you they went up off
the wall they went up after the war well
in the US actually tax rates started got
before the war but also the size of
government as a percentage of GDP was
like 30% it was a tiny like we're we're
now 45% of the UK economy is government
spending we have got a mass who funds
that spending debt they the bank of
England allows them to print endless
amounts of debt which deflates Gary I
want to get your opinion here cuz you're
asking a lot of questions but I actually
don't know your opinion I just want to
know what Daniel thinks and I want our
viewers to be able to research Daniel's
opinions but how how do you disagree
with those opinions listen Daniel's a
businessman he's obviously a very
successful businessman you know I I've
not been any I'm not a businessman I'm
not going to pretend to be a businessman
I'm an economist I make money by being
right on the economy Daniel's a good
businessman and I'm right on the economy
you know it's a simple as that basically
you know I'm not a good businessman but
I've got 15 years of being right on this
on the economy and look and I know
you're probably a wealthy man you
probably don't want to pay high taxes
you probably don't want your kids to pay
high taxes but we exist in an economy
where wealth is being extracted out of
the middle class out of the working
class very very rapidly it's benefiting
people like the three of us at this
table it will benefit our kids you know
our kids will be rich their kids will be
poor and I just think we should be
honest with them capitalism's finished
we won well done Stephen well done
Daniel well done Gary it's over now our
kids will be rich their kids will be
poor they'll pay the tax taxes we won't
pay the taxes we'll avoid it I'll make
money betting on it year after year why
are we lying to them why are we lying to
them yeah I I think that's an overly
simplified view of things I don't an
overly simplified view of things that
has made me a multimillionaire yeah well
look entrepreneurs take bets on the
economy as well we take bets differently
um when we start a company we're betting
on how the econ the average British and
American worker at the 50th percentile
do you think their kids will be richer
than they are it depends if we have
economic freedom or not right we're
going to have a split test on this right
we're going to have a split test we're
going to have the UK seems like we're
going to have more taxes more
regulations and it seems like the us is
going to have less taxes and less
regulations here's what I've noticed
I've noticed that places like Singapore
that have small governments um have got
widespread affluence there's not a lot
of poverty in Singapore yeah except for
the cleaners living in the closets yeah
you know uh look but we don't count them
in the statistics just like we don't
count our viewers that that's not
widespread in well there's a lot of
people W I've seen them in the closets
I've seen them in the closets there are
there are some but they're not
singaporeans well also you only count
the rich ones look the the also the
issue is is that they've come from even
worse conditions in many cases people
mve to Singapore for an increase in
lifestyle right the um you could take
Ireland or Switzerland right
economically free places Ireland was
economically in a disaster in think the
average Irish person lives well well the
their
economy their economy almost collapsed
in 2011 and they went down the road of
lower taxes lower regulations and they
attracted all sorts of businesses into
the economy and do you think that works
well for the average Irishman who
doesn't own a home in Dublin the the if
you measure everything by Home Ownership
I'm measuring people by the average I
want to know what the average man or
woman today lives that by the way I I'm
also Furious about the home ownership
thing everyone is um I think it's
utterly ridiculous the way like the idea
that homes are now worth 10 times the
average wage all of that difference is I
blame government for that uh I blame
high taxes where they've because of high
taxes they can take out more debt they
can then inflate the economy do you
think if we shrink the government if we
start to slash government spending do
you think that would improve living
conditions well the UK government is 45%
of the economy like that's a huge
government it's think using additions
will increase in the next few years
because we have US Government now that's
planning to slash the US government well
that's what the US voters have asked for
do you think it would improve living
conditions uh do I think it'll improve
the average American if they're smaller
government yeah I trust market so you
think the average US American will be
rich in years than the here what I trust
I trust economic freedom if people have
freedom they create better decisions for
their own life there's two ways to make
decisions right there's two ways you
have freedom I got less freedom than I
did when I ared just because my sister
can't pay the rent is that freedom the
if you're living in a country she can't
to live in the city that she was born in
I I agree you and I agree on the problem
you keep bringing back to the problem I
keep bringing it back to people because
the people who watch We're millionaires
okay the people who watch us are mostly
not
millionaires is life going to get better
for them they life will get better if
you are connected to the most productive
parts of the economy um if you pretend
that it's 1955 and you recreate the
postwar era conditions if you try to go
back to 1955 I don't think that's going
to work so so let me ask on that then
the point about if you're connected to
the most productive parts of the economy
I was quite um quite surprised when I
was doing some research on this to find
that there's quite big differences
between the UK and the US in terms of
GDP growth in Q4 2024 the US economy
grew by 6% while the UK growth was 0.1%
so they're doing significantly better in
that regard US GDP per head stands at
$82,000 per head whereas the UK stands
at $49,000 per head and stock market
performance which is an indication of I
guess what ever Rose by 300% in the US
whereas the footsy 100 declined by 20%
Which is the UK stock market
productivity growth since 2018
productivity increased by 30% in the
United States which has outpaced the the
UK and lastly income growth since 2007
American income per head has increased
by 72% while it has decreased in by 2%
in the UK in dollar terms so they seem
to be doing better from if you just look
at the economy um why is that is that
because they lean more into technology
and Innovation and Entrepreneurship and
is it because of the things you were
saying earlier about their attitude
towards the Govern like reduced
government spending versus tax the rich
why I'm Keen to hear Gary's view on this
because I understand yours because
you've just said it yeah I think these
are great statistics um and of course
the US has a strong reput reputation for
being very free markets and being very
small states in the last 5 years 10
years 15 years
we've had a UK government that has been
aggressively slashing the state and the
US State's bigger than ever it's 45% of
the economy and the us we had a
government in the last four years which
has been running a massive massive
deficit so in that period of
time it appears the government which has
been aggressively increasing its deficit
has massively overperformed the
government which has been aggressively
slashing the
state that's what it looks to be from
the last I mean b Joe Biden in
enormously increased the deficit
enormously and the conservatives were
austerity government for 14 years which
one seems to have given the better
numbers well I mean there were austerity
in name only they went from 30% uh the
state was 30% of GDP to 45% of
government services haveed now they're
the government is terrible at doing most
things that's the problem you you you
don't want you don't think that spending
on government service has been slashed
let me let me zoom out a little you
think the police spending has been
slashed OH police spending is definitely
do you know where it ends up it ends up
with like big corporates uh big
Consulting who get paid $50 million to
produce a report to tell government some
thing right all of these big I won't
name names but all the big consulting
firms they're all blood suckers to
government they they know that the money
is in the government and they set up
business models to extract that money
from government uh and it also is in the
financial trading side of things the one
of the issues that we've got right and
this is a big big issue as well cuz you
care about wealth inequality one of the
biggest issues I see is that during the
pandemic we all learned to work remotely
and remotor became the norm and what I
see at the moment is huge amounts of
what would have been normal British jobs
are going to the Philippines going to
India going to uh Vietnam people who
work remotely now we now have a thousand
millionaires a month leaving to go to
Dubai we have 120,000 British people
living in Dubai uh in in that economy
the world's become incredibly mobile and
one of the things that's happening is
that what would have previously been
good British jobs uh are getting moved
overseas to lower cost countries and
that's technology that drives that wedge
the US is very smart in that they've
built a technology Powerhouse and the UK
has completely lost our technology
industry our tech industry is in Decline
same same across Europe China and the us
know that the game is Tech and they've
basically pulling all the tech company
into the into their uh borders and
what's happening a lot is the erosion of
good jobs and the erosion of of just
normal well-paying uh jobs because they
they're going and it's a bit of a
self-fulfilling Loop that the more we
lose millionaires the tax burden falls
on everyone else so they put the taxes
up and then the millionaires say oh the
taxes are too high so they leave um I've
watched some of the most incredible
entrepreneurs that you would want here
that would employ your sister at a high
rate um and they've picked up and left
cuz the taxes are too high so you saying
we should tax working people less well
the the the overall government has to be
smaller uh you can't whoever what do you
want to cut in the government if you uh
yeah I mean you'd have to Child Services
we'd have to no police no education NHS
all I know is this pensions you go to
Switzerland they SP single mothers 25%
disabled benefits what do you want to
cut hold up all I know is in Switzerland
I tell you what I want the government is
TA on those entrepreneurs and raise the
taxes on the billionaires because I
worked my tits off how many billionaires
are in the UK there's a lot of
billionaires in the UK 150 yeah so tax
them more what do they pay listen I went
my tits off and I paid it was 50% top
rate tax 50% top rate tax plus National
Insurance 60% million to bring my family
out of poverty at the same time the Duke
of Westminster inherited 10 billion and
paid nothing do you think that's fair
that's not true okay why is it not true
because the Duke of Westminster is one
of the highest tax payers in the country
what does he pay well on the trust the
groer estate uh they don't pay
inheritance tax because trusts can't die
they pay something called periodic taxes
which how much 6% every 10 years 6% so
they pay 0.6% so I paid 16% and this guy
pays 0.6% apples with apples inheritance
tax is 40% across the course of your
life if a trust is uh if a person lives
who owns a trust for 70 years then 6%
time 7 would be 42 so they actually pay
more so he pays 0.6% a year Pro 0.6%
that would be the same as what percent
did I pay per no no no but that's 60% so
you're saying I pay what 60 of a 0.6
what 100 times the tax not comparing
apples with apples wait why is it not
apples with apples this guy pays 0.6% a
year I paid 60% a year that's
inheritance tax I paid that 60% every
year Daniel every year I paid you're pay
income tax so why have I du P more than
the Duke of Westminster pays income tax
he probably he probably makes your bill
blush yeah think can pay his income tax
yeah well if he's going to live he has
to withdraw money to have his income he
also let me give you a list of all the
taxes he would pay he'd pay income tax
corporate tax he'd pay stamp Duty when
he buys a building he pays uh uh any of
the other taxes vat when he spends money
all the same taxes apply to a duuk as
they apply to anybody else so you think
he pays income tax on on the income on
that any income he draws okay well our
viewers can research whether he pays
income tax on his income because I don't
think he does
it's in a trust but the only difference
with the trust versus income is that the
trust pays periodic tax versus
inheritance tax 0.6% but we're only
talking inherit that that's just one
type of tax you think he's paying 60% on
his income he's one of the highest
taxpayers in the UK I'm not like his big
fan club but the truth is he's one of
the highest taxpayers in the UK um he's
one of the biggest Employers in the UK
he's one of the like one of the biggest
land owners in the UK land owners in the
UK right uh so uh the the issue is is
does he pay tax all the same taxes that
apply to you apply to him uh and if you
want to set up a trust you can also pay
periodic taxes as well um which would be
on top of all the other taxes so what
would you say but it's just not true
that he doesn't pay tax no what would
you say this guy has inherit 1010
million P so he's worth 10 billion PS
what would you say will be the total
amount of tax he will pay in his
lifetime well I know that just the
smallest if I make 10 million I pay 60%
just one sec you're not you're talking
about income versus the transfer of an
estate so why why is it that the be 10
million P just you're comparing your
income yeah versus the amount he
inherited which is not a fair thing
that's not income that's his income he
inheritance is not income so wait wait
wait wait wait wa so if I get given1
billion I don't pay any tax but if I
work for10 billion I pay 60% well if you
inherit this is the tax system that you
want you'll end up in a system where the
kids of the richual own everything
that's what I'm saying that's what I'm
saying and that's fun because that's our
kids you're not telling the truth about
his let's support it let's have a tax
system where your kids and my kids and
Steven's kids are multimillionaires and
these guys out there can't afford to
feed their kids and put the heat in
that's not what I'm saying but that's
what you will get that is what you will
get that's listen that's what I'm
betting on that's fine because I'll make
money in the markets it's fine and
you'll make money and you'll make money
it's our viewers who will be poor and
that's fine that's fine that's fine for
us let's let's explore the other
alternative right so let's say tax the
rich right so let's play the game of tax
the rich tax the owners not the workers
the owners
so the issue that we have with the rich
is that is the number one most valuable
Assets in the economy now in tangible
assets so there's this chart called the
S&P 500 of the 500 richest countries in
the country uh in the world in the US
sorry um in
1970s 75% of the value of the S&P 500
was physical assets like property um and
today it's less than 10% uh it's closer
to 5% you think that housing is not
particularly important just just let's
stick stick with what I'm saying okay
the the the PowerHouse the engine room
of the economy is digital assets and
that's reflected in uh the S&P 500 for
example which is 95% intangible assets
one of the issues that we have is that
the richest people are completely mobile
now so they can be absolutely anywhere
in the world so if you come up with this
idea of let's tax richest people 1% if a
tiny proportion of them leave we're all
in trouble so this really rich guys
M what do they own companies and why are
those companies worth money because
investors say they are and where do the
revenues come from globally okay the
issue is is that these companies operate
globally now so take my company for
example my company has 8,000 customers
in 150 countries okay we could be
anywhere if you P what country is your
biggest single Revenue Source probably
the US now let's say you move to Cayman
Island and the US says we're going to
tax your Revenue at point of sale M what
can you do well that's different right
because that's not taxing billionaires
that's taxing
companies see when you say tax the rich
on their wealth yeah that's different to
saying tax companies a consumption tax
oh but you just said the're Rich owned
companies you said that's what they own
yeah but you're saying how do you tax
them right so do they do you tax their
wealth which is what they own or do you
tax the companies where they trade um
typically consumption taxes get passed
on to Consumers it's not consumption tax
it's the tax on the ownership yeah but
if you simply say when you're doing
revenues then that's a consumption we
start to tax if we start to taxit by the
way I'm not exactly against you on on
companies I think it's disgusting that a
British company can can take out a
Facebook ad to sell to a British
consumer a British product and Facebook
pretends to be in Ireland on that
transaction um and Amazon you can buy
something on Amazon in Britain from a
British supplier from a British
warehouse and Amazon pretends to be in
Luxembourg in that situation and that
sucks right like that that does not seem
fair and it strikes me as very strange
that the government is okay with that
right now the government is chasing down
moms and dads who sell a few things on
eBay uh and chasing them for taxes but
they don't talk to eBay uh they they
they're paranoid about someone doing a
little bit of a side hustle on Facebook
but Facebook's fine to pretend to be an
Ireland so I don't agree with all of all
of that right like I think where missing
some serious tricks here but the idea
with taxing billionaires at wealth
billionaires will just leave they just
get up and leave and and not just
billionaires but what the billionaires
own what the billionaires own companies
and where do companies get their money
from revenues and where do the revenues
come from purchasing people purchasing
where do those people live all over the
world we can tax them at that point
that's consumption tax this is the thing
that's a consumption tax no it's not
it's V is a tax on Revenue tax these
guys on profits based on where the
revenues come from so it's very easy to
move profits internationally see Steven
had a uh Starbucks cup when he buys that
Starbucks yeah it's bought from a
British company who licenses the
Starbucks logo from Luxembourg or
somewhere like that so 15% so here we
are saying oh we're going to tax their
profits they say ah I wish we were
profitable sorry unfortunately we had to
do that licensing deal with that
International I know how profit shifting
works okay so are you you think are you
telling
me compan selling to the UK the US
enormous amount of of profit in the US
and they turn around and say actually
our profit is not in the US the
difference you think the US is in is is
incapable of going and looking if that's
seeing where they really where the
profit is I'm not saying that you can't
do this I'm saying that the benefits of
doing it it's so hard to tax wealth for
example or it's so hard to tax uh
Millionaires and billionaires that that
you end up cutting off your nose despite
your face um for every like if we
Britain for example and we build a brand
which is that we're anti- wealth we
don't want you to ever have more than 10
million if you've got more than 10
million we punish you every young
entrepreneur who comes to me and says
dan do you think I should start a
company here in this country I'm going
to say well if you do uh they'll take it
as soon as you start to make it they'll
take it as soon as if you're successful
if you get investment they're going to
tax you at your wealth if you sell the
company they're going to take it off you
I'm going to basically say to that young
entrepreneur don't build your business
in brit go start it somewhere that
they're more proactive and positive
towards entrepreneurs are we seeing that
now with this they call it the
millionaire Exodus which is for people
that don't know the UK has set to lose
the greatest proportion of millionaires
in the world um this Parliament I'll put
a graph on the screen which is this one
here this one here and that little red
line here is US losing all of our
millionaires at the moment and in 2024
it's an estimated that 10,800 high net
worth individuals left the UK which is
57% increase from the previous year
which means that 1 millionaire is
departing every 45 minutes the UK
millionaire Exodus is equal to losing
530,000 average taxpayers and another
stat the top 10% of earners in the US
account for nearly half of all consumer
spending the top 1% of income taxpayers
in the UK are projected to contribute
about 30% of total income tax from 2024
to
2025 why are all these millionaires
running away well it's not because
they're taxing their world because we
don't have any wealth taxes why why do
you think they're leaving I think the
reason they're leaving is because the UK
economy is is really really weak because
the UK consumer is really really weak
because you've absolutely crushed the
spending power of your average British
family your average British family can
barely afford to feed the kids and turn
the heating on so why are you going to
start a business here when the customers
are absolutely impoverished look it
corresponds with a new tax that we
brought in which was um we ended the
non-dom scheme so the non-dom scheme
basically said if you're living in the
UK but you've got businesses all over
the world uh then we only tax you on
what you've got in the UK um and if you
die in the UK uh we'll only tax you on
your UK assets for inheritance tax if
you're a non-dom uh but if you die in
the UK and you've got uh wealth in India
once that nonon scheme ended they
basically said we will tax you on
everything globally if you're an
economic uh if you're a tax resident in
the UK everything you've got globally we
want 40% of it so unfortunately every
wealth manager contacted their clients
and said you can't stay here you're
going to have to get out um it's it's
gotten really bad a th000 people a month
are leaving and in the UK 1% of people
pay 30% of the taxes 10% of people pay
60% of the taxes and you imagine if
we're sitting out at dinner and there's
10 of us out to dinner and one person
says hey I've got this I get I'll get
60% of the bill tonight we say to them
no it should be 70% should be 80% and
they say you know what I'll get up and
leave so they leave everyone else's bill
just doubled so what's going to happen
is if we drive the millionaires out of
this country everyone every ordinary
normal person who pays 10 grand a year
in tax will now have to pay 20 grand a
year in tax so the reason they left
because we used to allow them to not pay
tax and we Ta on their Global incomes on
their Global isn't it a bit more like if
we were 10 of us at dinner and there was
one guy who came on to dinner on the
condition he wouldn't pay their leaves
because these guys weren't paying tax
anyway the reason they left is because
they weren't paying tax it's like saying
um it's like saying hey I'll pay 60% of
this table and they say at the table hey
wait a second we also want you to pay
for everything that's happening at other
restaurants as well isn't it a bit more
like these guys we're stretching on a
condition you you yourself said the
reason why they left is because we let
them live here on the condition that
they didn't have to pay taxes on their
Global yeah taxes matter right so why
why is everyone going to Dubai Dubai
they're going there because there's no
tax these guys they live in Dubai their
money comes from the West they are
making money from the West while your
average Western ordinary person watching
this show now cannot afford to buy a
house cannot afford to have a family we
can tax those revenues at the point of
sale why do we allow these it's a called
a consumption tax no it's not it's a tax
on tax on profit not tax on consumption
you just said at point of sale which
means it's a consumption tax based on
the profits you look at how much profit
they where the profits exactly it's not
consumption tax what I'm saying so no so
if you tax profits yeah right then those
profits have to accumulate in that
country and because of the digital
ecosystem that we now have the world we
now live in I can lease the database off
of my company in Luxembourg I can uh
license the I can license my logo from
understand how profit
shifting listen these guys are not
gandal you just say we don't accept
profit shifting we don't need to accept
profit shifting China does not accept
profit shifting we did not accept profit
shifting 50 years ago we do not have to
accept profit shifting but you have a
government class who are extremely
wealthy and a media class are extremely
wealthy saying it's impossible to tax
rich people and I would like to say I
will agree 100% it is difficult to tax
rich people it is very very very
difficult to tax rich people I don't I
don't come here saying I want to tax
rich people because it's easy I know
it's hard I know probably I'm going to
lose I know our viewers kids will live
in Desperate poverty I know that I do
this because it is hard if we are a
country which says to ourselves we don't
try and do things which are necessary to
keep our kids out of poverty because
they are hard then our kids will live in
poverty I don't need to be here I'm a
multimillionaire just like you I could
be in the Philippines drinking panac
laders I come in here because I come
from a poor background and it's ordinary
families like my family like the kids I
grew up with whose kids are going to be
in poverty it's difficult but it is
necessary sometimes we have to do things
not because they're easy but because
they are hard that is what makes a rich
country rich and that is what protects
ordinary people listen our grandparents
lived in poverty did they say let's not
change it because it's hard no they
didn't they fought and they demanded
they demanded Health Care education
housing food and they got it they got it
that's why my parents could live a good
quality life they got those things they
got those things and they were aware
that in order to do that you could not
allow the super rich who have been
living lives of luxury for hundreds and
hundreds of years to eat everything
while ordinary families couldn't afford
to feed their kids I know it's difficult
I know it's difficult and I know I'm
probably going to lose I know that I
know I'm probably going to lose and that
means our viewers will be poor but I do
it anyway because I do not want this
country that I grew up in to fall into
desperate poverty I agree with you on
the passion and I agree with you on the
problem I don't agree with you on the
solution because in 2019 we be kids in
2020 and that's not what I'm saying in
2020 we made a decision globally to shut
down the economy and we taught everyone
that they can live and work from
anywhere the biggest threat to
everything you're saying is remote
working the fact that we can live and
work work from anywhere our grandparents
their boss if their boss owned a company
that company had to physically be in the
country and the boss had to physically
be in the country if we look at today
there are plenty of fitness trainers who
work for a gym and the owner of that gym
is somewhere overseas plenty of people
work in live work in a restaurant and
the owner of the restaurant lives
overseas you can live in you can run a
business from anywhere in the world
right now so the problem that we face is
that you're describing on one hand you
say we need to tax it at the point of
sale which is a consumption tax and not
tax on profit okay and then you say a
tax on profit and then you say oh but
then we'll stop profit shifting by the
way I'm also actually all for this idea
of stopping profit I I've already said I
think it's utterly ridiculous the way
that many of these global companies are
treated and if we don't stop that then
all the money just flows out to the tech
companies um so I'm I'm with you on that
but when you say tax the rich the actual
people who own the companies those
people can be anywhere right now so but
but their revenues can't their customers
their customers are where their
customers are their customers are where
their customers are listen Amazon
doesn't pay any UK tax doesn't pay any
us tax where are the customers in the UK
and Us in UK US do you really think it's
impossible for us to tax that well
you're talking about taxing people at 10
million plus right so this is a lot of
startup entrepreneurs Jeff Bez is a lot
more than 10 million jez Jeff worth a
lot more than you talk about anyone
above 10 million is on your radar you
don't want people worth 11 million
pounds we pay more I'm not just talk
it's not that Dan if you you you're
worth more than 10 million pounds so if
we tax people
on as Gary says that have more than 10
million what are your options to avoid
say if your objective was to avoid that
what options do you have look if if my
objective was to avoid it I pass a board
resolution that we're moving the head
office somewhere else yeah um we move
the intellectual property somewhere else
I pick up and move my family somewhere
else and within about a week or two
we've got a we work office somewhere
else I've got a new house on Airbnb
somewhere else and I cut ties with the
UK and I'm non- tax resident here and I
can I have a digital business I can
literally make my head office anywhere
in the world if there was a particular
country that turned hostile towards uh
our operations they not have to withdraw
service from that thing you know so that
that's possible but it's unlikely that
that would actually happen but
ultimately if I choose to get up and
leave then I get up and leave now the
the the bigger issue is would I have
even come here in the first place and
then there's another issue and here's
the other issue Gary for you you've just
had 750,000 subscribers to your YouTube
channel 820 it's 8:20 right so it's
going up fast I could have one of my
analysts at a consulting company do
valuation of your brand and do valuation
of your YouTube channel we could say
this is a fast growth media company and
it's worth 11 million right so we could
come up with a forecast and a projection
and we say Gary's economics is actually
a new Fast growth media brand it's worth
11 million now your channel now you have
to pay 100 Grand a year in extra taxes
because you're a millionaire sorry 1% on
wealth above 10 million on 11 million is
going to be 10 grand taxes oh you're
saying only on the part above that's how
taxes work so it's not on everything
it's okay so it's a it's a marginal tax
that's how taxes work it's so okay so
but is it fair that like who gets to
decide what wealth Is wealth and what
it's worth because wealth let's just hit
me out wealth is a a technical term for
unrealized gains right it's not real uh
you know someone buys a house for 20
grand and it's worth 200 Grand uh
they've still got the same house but now
they've got wealth um if someone starts
a business and a tiny little seed
investor puts in a little angel
investment uh now they've got wealth on
paper but who gets to say what is wealth
um like for
example if you introduce wealth taxes
theoretically that will actually reduce
the value of wealth of things anyway
because things in inside that economy
are now subject to a disadvantage so
therefore investors will be unlikely to
invest in them to a certain point and
also people start cutting and dodging
and weaving and ducking and weaving so
they say oh our UK operations worth 10
million so we're now going to start a
second company over in some other
country and make sure that that's where
the wealth accumulates so it's
incredibly difficult because it is just
unrealized gains I know I know it's
difficult yeah I know I know these guys
have the best accountants I I know it's
difficult I know so what if there was an
easier solution if there was an easier
solution I would support that you know
what I mean it's called it's called
economic freedom the economic freedom
index okay well just tell the viewers
that give them more economic freedom and
then they'll be rich yeah so this this
diagram here basically says the most
free countries have less than 10%
poverty in fact less than 7% poverty as
soon as you reduce economic freedom it
jumps to 30% poverty you reduce economic
freedom again and it jumps up to huge
huge amounts of poverty so the these
countries here are the least
economically free and these countries
are the most economically free the
countries that get in the way of your
economic freedom have more poverty and
the countries that let people make
decisions for their own life what you're
saying is if the governments of our
countries cut taxes on us the three
multimillionaire sitting at this table
that will improve the lives of the
ordinary British and American give a
real life example to feed their kids
I'll give you a real life example uh I
know of a company that was going to give
pay Rises to its employees and then
National Insurance went up and instead
of National Insurance is a tax on
employment yeah I'm saying to reduce
that I'm saying to reduce tax on I want
your viewers the viewers here to be
paying less tax while multimillionaires
pay more tax good in theory but of if
you could tax rich people 1% of their
wealth above 10 million uh I did a back
of a napkin cap calculation you might be
able to get 20 billion yeah right that's
if they don't leave that's if they don't
respond to it if they just happily pay
it you get 20 billion that's less than a
week worth of current government
spending
so the government's out of control 1.2
trillion a year of government spending
is now what they spend okay so let's cut
that get that 20 billion and cut the
taxes for the viewers cut their income
tax so that works out about 250 a year
okay so let's do more let's make it 60
billion so then you tax 3% above wealth
yeah do that right and then you also
bring it down this is what governments
do make five or six yeah and then and
that's what they did that's what they
did in the second world war and that's
why my dad could afford a house actually
that's not why you could afford a house
okay well who's buy if Ordinary People
are losing their houses and the wealth
which they are yeah and we're getting
richer yeah who is it who is now owning
the houses if it is not us the
government used to own the houses and
then they sold the government wealth is
collapsing government wealth is
collapsing but what they did is they
sold the houses to the people okay but
but ordinary middle is also you can only
do that once and they did it for the
baby so you think it's our viewers who
have got my houses now who where is the
wealth going Daniel where is the wealth
going who has the wealth now who is
getting rich who is getting the wealth
that is lost by our viewers I'll tell
you where the biggest amounts of money
are going the biggest amounts of money
uh since the pandemic uh 11 trillion
went just to the value of seven
companies that own te technology so the
biggest seven companies in the USA 11
trillion has and you don't want their
billionaire owners to pay more tax well
would that help the UK well if you use
that money to reduce tax on working
people then it it would help yeah they
own shares in the USA they're US
citizens so that doesn't help us here
but it will help the American Consumer
and then we can export the American
Consumer and it will mean the American
Consumer has money and then it will show
British people how much you can achieve
by taxing Super Rich we can raise tax on
our Super Rich here and then what I want
is these guys to be taxed so much that
they start to sell assets and then
ordinary British people can buy assets
again because what I want is our viewers
to be able to own things to be able to
own their own homes I when I hear this
um I admissibly don't know as much about
these issues as you guys do but when I
hear that there's these seven tech
companies in the US my brain goes can't
we have one here yeah yeah can't we
start and then so my brain goes how what
conditions do we have to create ones
that we had yeah what conditions do we
have to create to have one of those
seven tech companies here especially in
this sort of AI World we're heading
towards where when I was reading through
the stats most of the investment in AI
which is going to be hugely
destabilizing across every industry from
driving to to any form of knowledge work
even podcasting I can play your podcast
now yeah which sounds exactly like me
which has a 4.6 star rating on Apple
which was written by AI in my voice
published by AI Wild and the and who's
acing the value there well it's a
company in America called 11 labs and
it's bloody open Ai and I why why can't
we have those companies here we need
them here because China and the US are
dominating this next
Revolution um and I I worry as a
bystander that if we don't create
entrepreneurship friendly environments
here we're going to we are going to
become Indian yeah M so you if you want
businesses that to thrive you don't need
just a good environment for
entrepreneurs you also need people to
have money that they can spend MH and we
are in a country where
increasingly most of the people out
there have almost nothing left over at
the end of the month they can barely pay
the bills those companies are selling
globally right so they don't need any
particular company to do well they just
they sell to anywhere so like open AI
chat GPT we're all using that Bloody
product and pay our 20 $30 a month yeah
where do they actually get their money
from right they get their money from
selling data to to to the rich right my
point was making the environment more
friendly for entrepreneurs because when
I start a company I am at a I can't
explain the disadvantage I'm at at the
moment if I start that kind of company
here in the UK there's no investors and
then all the talent seems to flock over
to San Francisco so the the guys that
built the British guys that built an AI
company called fixer which I was going
to invest in all British Lads from
London they went over to San Francisco
they're like 25y olds they've just
raised at a 60 million valuation they're
in this room this building in San
Francisco full of entrepreneurs and
they're pumping knowledge and capital
into this room with all due respect
Stephen you're not a great example for
the fact that it's impossible to start a
successful online brand in the UK facts
um but I also realized that the problem
of of but he started when things were
different but I I also realized I don't
like using personal examples because
there's a huge amount of privilege and
okay is there a chat gbt in Germany No
is there a chat gbt in in France no is
there a chat GPT in Australia no no is
there a chat GPT in ja it's China and
one sec SEC yeah exactly what you have
here is an extremely low labor extremely
high Capital model which employs
extremely few people across the entire
world that is focused in basically two
cities yeah good luck competing with
that H how do we create an environment
where the UK can start to build some of
these companies which are going to
capitalize on this next technological
Revolution how if you were prime
minister what would you do I think you
need to look realistically about what
companies do we have a chance of growing
you know I'm not an expert in AI but I
think trying to compete with San
Francisco in London would will probably
not work why try try and do it you know
try and do it and listen I know that you
can get a lot of likes saying let's just
invest in AI let's just invest only one
city in the world outside of China has
Managed IT China has Managed IT by
basically State capitalism you know this
is very similar in a sense to what we
had with micro Electronics in Japan in
the 8S right when you have a new
industry especially these industries
which are very Capital intense and don't
employ many people you get a first move
Advantage they tend to win eventually
often they get undercut by cheaper
Rivals and that does happen you know
that does happen and you might stand in
AI I don't think AI is going to become a
massive massive employer of course you
know a lot of countries are going to be
like because basically it sounds good
we're going to invest in I we're going
to invest in AI personally I think we
should be looking at what does the
British person need you know we live in
a country where the housing stock is
falling apart if if we say AI when we
talk about AI I think we're actually
talking about technology because even a
podcast like a podcast like this you
don't think this of this as an AI
company but actually now the editing
process the scripting process the
transcription process even YouTube
itself is an AI company so it's it's
really technology we're speaking about
here and I'm wondering why we can't
create a better environment in the UK to
start launching and building some of
these technology companies we've even
seen I think we should and I think we
should be looking we should be look at
reducing taxes on people who who work
and make money this is what I've been
saying for the whole time what about
people what about people who start
companies
yeah we should reduce their taxes on the
income that they make but then if they
start owning A50 million pound company
are you telling me if you come to me and
I say all right you want to start a
company we we tax you very very little
on a company that you start if that
company becomes worth 20 30 40 million
quid then we're going to start taxing
you you're going to come and say to me
oh no sorry 50 million is not enough for
me so can I ask a question on that so um
my company was was valued at x 50
whatever 100 Millions um congratulations
I still had because I hadn't had an exit
event yeah I still had 101,000 20,000 in
my bank account are you saying at the
point when I sell the company or are you
saying just because I have shares from
the company I think you can structure it
a number of ways you can structure a
number of ways my preferred way is to
stop people from hoarding enormous a of
wealth for enormous amounts of time
that's my that's basically my preferred
method there's also the wealth tax
method there's also capital gains as a
method there's a lot of different ways
it there's a lot of different ways but
you have to deal with the problem of if
you do not do not tax very wealthy
individuals and very wealthy families
their share of the pie will obviously
goow over time and they will and they
are as we are watching squeezing our
ordinary families you have to deal with
that my friend sold his company in the
UK it's a company everybody knows um and
he I remember him saying to me at the
time it was in the middle of the
pandemic he got this big exit event I
think he'd made 300 million and he goes
I'm off I go where you going he goes I'm
going to go to Dubai in Monaco and live
between the two and I I said explain to
me why he goes well the amount of tax
I'd have to pay in the UK is equivalent
to me paying 20 million rent in the UK
for the next six or seven years which
he'd have to stay here for so he he went
and he pops back in every now and then
but it meant that he could keep that 150
million whatever tax he would pay never
had to pay it to the UK is living this
highflying life now in Dubai drops into
Monaco every now and then um and I
remember him saying to me well Steve I'd
have to pay 20 million rent a year to
live here and he went on to say the UK
product is just isn't worth it he goes
crime I'm going to get my Rolex robbed
off me he goes um the healthare system
isn't the best the education system
isn't necessarily the best and the
particular one was crime which is I'll
get I'll get i'll get mugged walking
through yeah London streets Stephen if
you allow British people who own 300
million pound of British assets to
technically live in Monaco and not pay
tax then you will get crime and you will
have dirty streets and you will have a
bad Health Care system and you will have
education because if you give all of the
wealth to a group of people who do not
tax there will be nothing left to
provide things like healthcare and
education for ordinary people it's not
unconnected these people are not
technically living there they're moving
out my friends have moved out of the
country they don't come back to the UK
they've left and they leave with their
they built a company here they glob P
tax they typically build globally
business it's not that they P it was a
global they don't pay no tax they pay
extortionate amounts of tax right anyone
who's here is paying extraordinary taxes
more than they've ever paid before 1%
pays 30% 10% pays 60% of 1 trillion a
year gu 300 million how much tax Rec
he's paid in his life I have no idea I
have no idea his business was Global
that his biggest customer was the US
it's I pay 60% and our viewers will pay
30 40 50% do you think it's fair that
your 300 million guy pays his two or
three I have no idea what he pays well
it sounds like he didn't pay 50% well he
dashed when before he got the tax bill
but why did we allow it why did we allow
I I'm not allowed to not pay my tax what
could you have done to you are allowed
to when you were in Japan you wouldn't
have paid UK taxes
yeah because I was working in Japan and
I pay Japanese taxes because you're
living in Japan this is the thing people
can live wherever they want now so but
we're talking about this is I think we
should stop obfuscating tax on people's
work from tax on the ass they uh so I'm
talking about entrepreneurs work
generates wealth so when if I if I ear a
billion pound of British houses yeah and
then I say I live in Dubai yeah and I'm
getting the rent on a billion pounds of
houses which would probably be something
like like that's going to be something
like 50 million a year so I'm getting 60
50 60 million a year of rent from
British people yeah and that gets paid
to me from British people yeah and I pay
and I don't pay tax I live in Dubai do
you think that's fair no all right so
let's change that let's let's make
people pay tax on on their world
regardless where they live yeah the
question would be though how would you
tax people right and how would you
actually structure it because regardless
of what you feel like is fair this is
the thing it's not about fairness it's
about what you can pragmatic and
practically do in the modern economy you
might say oh I actually like for example
if we said what's fair a lot of people
would say a flat tax is fair you make
one pound you pay 20% you make a million
pounds you pay 20% make 100 million
pounds you pay 20% so a lot of people
would say the fairest tax system would
just be a flat tax on everything right
that would be a fair thing it's
pragmatically can you do it is it
actually good for society should people
be excluded from that so it's not about
fairness it's about pragmatically what
can you get away with all right well
pragmatically what we can get away with
is desperate poverty for our viewers
kids if you want to have can we zoom out
just a minute right I want to zoom out
let's Zoom away from our viewers kids
forget about them they're not I got I'm
a dad right I got three kids you're you
are a multimillionaire dad you probably
don't have the same problems as our
viewers do you know that do you know
that kids born into the top have a 60%
chance of dropping out of the top right
60% that's the number it's called
persistence you can Google it um the
persistence rates is actually only 40%
for the richest so which means 60% drop
out in the second you think kids have a
60% chance of living in poverty POS not
poverty do you know what's interesting
we're all trying to aim at the same goal
I think here I'm not sure we are but
well that's fair that's fair maybe we're
not I suspect some of us are maybe
trying to protect our kids I want
widespread affluence through the
technological Revolution that's
happening and I don't want the people
who create that to want to go somewhere
else so you agree with me that we should
cut tax on wealth creators and raise tax
on wealth
orders uh well broadly okay so let's do
it let's cut on people who are making
let cut tax on people who are working
hard creating a good product making a
good income and let's raise tax on
people who are sitting there on 20 30 40
100 200 500 million pounds of assets
that they're going to give to their kids
and they're going to use to dominate
society and squeeze out the middle class
so who's an example of someone who's
hoarding wealth she so his family owns a
tech company
his wife's dad owns a tech compan which
he will inherit and his kids will
inherit his net worth that is quoted is
based upon his wife's but that company
already exists yeah it's created now
yeah it's worth billions but they they
have to reinvent that business every two
years like it's a so you think that the
reason you think that if R's
father-in-law stopped managing the
company it would be valueless no I think
it it it hires hundreds of thousands of
people and it's you know it's a big
company I don't know a lot about that
particular company but I know it's a
tech company Steve Jobs died okay is
Apple valueless no let's not pretend
that these creators are the sole reason
these companies are are valuable sure
you know and what we're talking about in
many cases you know I was a Trader okay
and I'm worth a millions of quid and you
know now that is just assets I just own
the assets I own the assets and that
will grow and it will grow and it will
grow and it will grow and that will
squeeze out and squeeze out and squeeze
out and squeeze out our viewers and I'll
give that to my kids they don't even
need to work they wouldn't even have
even have to work they could just live
on I could live on off the wealth is
that what you want do uh do you think
there are any opportunities for people
today like if you're born into a poor
family do you think it's possible that
housing being and we can both agree
agree on that but do you think there are
new opportunities that didn't exist for
our parents or grandparents but they do
exist for people today I think the
reality is for kids from poor
backgrounds it is almost
impossible to realistically get even
Financial Security never mind wealth but
why do you think you could do it I could
do it he could do it but you don't think
other people could do it well the first
thing is I'm 38 now so I'm not not a kid
nowadays um listen I want every Mass
competition I've ever been in you know
what I mean since I was a little kid I
didn't even have a desk in my house you
know I was one of the top students at
LC and I still had to win my job by
cheating in a card game you know that's
the world that we live in I don't think
that's a very replicable strategy and
it's very easy for People Like Us who've
made money to say oh AR we did it aren't
we great go out and you know you've said
that you think if young people go and
work in Tech business they can get
Financial Security if it was that easy
they'd all be doing it you know they're
not idiots our viewers are not idiots
they're trying trying they're trying
they want to find the good opportunities
and they work listen I speak I'm the one
saying they're idiots you're the one who
says that they can't do it anymore I I
see people do it all the time like I'm
working in entrepreneurs people from
poor backgrounds and so so then so but
then why are I VI you think all of our
if it was that easy why is everybody not
doing it I'll tell you why people aren't
doing it we went through a schooling
system that taught us how to get an
office job okay right we went through a
schooling system to prepare us for a uh
a world that doesn't really exist
anymore which is the Industrial
Revolution world and you have to go
through a process of figuring out how it
really works so what what I see is the
most often the people who do really well
financially who are young they dropped
out of school they dropped out of
University they started learning how to
do things uh by doing their own research
they start their own business or
co-found a business they take a very
alternative path uh none of that was
taught to us at school none of it's
taught to us in normal society we have a
school system that manufactures people
for a set of skills that are not
particularly valuable anymore and we
also get them in debt for those skills
um when people Sid step that and say
okay I'm not going to get into
University debt I'm just going to go off
and actually figure out how the world
works there's actually loads of
opportunities okay so I guess we've
sorted it then all our viewers need to
do is go and buy Dan's book become an
entrepreneur and become a millionaire
it's that easy why W you guys doing it
to begin with they're idiots the viewers
are idiots they should be just being
more entrepreneurial it's as simple as
that more entrepreneurial start a
business listen I come from East London
okay my friends can't feed their kids
okay and if it was as simple as going
out and be an entrepreneur I can bet you
they would do it I can bet you they
would do it let us I'm sick of
multi-millionaires telling kids who
can't afford to turn the heating on you
just need to be more entrepreneurial
it's sick Dan it's sick I this gives
people mental illness it gives people
mental illness tell them the truth okay
we your older generation we took the
opportunities and now is almost
impossible to out of poverty and don't
just don't just stand up and wave you
know your millions of pounds in front of
them and say if you entrepreneurial like
me you could do it you could have it
because it's sick because they can't
they can't feed their kids down they
can't turn the heating on don't tell
them to be more entrepreneurial fix the
system that drives more and more and
more of them into poverty every
generation I find it very strange that
you think it would be easier to fix the
entire global economic system than to
start a business and fix your own
personal economics the the thing that
the thing that I know that gives people
mental health issues is feeling that
they have no agency in their life that
they can't do anything your video where
you talk about if you don't have a rich
dad you're screwed there's no such thing
as meritocracy you're never going to be
successful to me if I had have come
across your content at 19 20 years old I
would have been screwed I was so I'm so
glad that I came across people who said
Daniel you weren't born into a a rich
family you don't have any Bank of mom
and dad but it's cheap and easier than
ever to start a business start by
working for someone who's got a business
then figure out what's your opportunity
and there's a way there is a way I've
actually worked with a lot of teenagers
from poor backgrounds and one of the
things we do is we tell them if it's
possible for someone else it is possible
for you um I also worked in rural Uganda
um with a charity that did uh work with
the poorest of the poor um one of the
most incredible things I ever saw was a
woman who started
out literally picking food out of a
trash uh pile um and she was basically
sh they they shared with her how to
start a chicken business which then
ended up as a pig business which then
ended up as a cattle business and she
ended up uh making uh hiring 15 16
people in her local community the power
of Entrepreneurship is that starting
with nothing you can
actually make improvements I'm not
saying everyone ends up as a millionaire
and I'm not saying everyone ends up uh
equal but I'm saying you can make
improvements in your life and the thing
that causes mental health issues is the
feeling of having no agency or no
control over your circumstances until
the world changes the whole economic
system I never told people don't work
hard I never once said that never once
said that never said that you said if
your dad wasn't Rich you'll never be
rich which is true in 99.9% of cases
I've never told people don't work hard
true 99% I've never told people don't
work hard okay and listen if you think
that ugandans should be more
entrepreneurial I've never been to
Uganda maybe that's the problem out
there maybe that's the problem in
Nigeria maybe that's the problem in
India listen I've never said don't work
hard okay when I brought my book out
last year the hardback I was at some
event and I come out I was drinking
London Bridge and uh I come out late it
was like it was like 1:00 a.m. and um
some guy come up to me when I was
unlocking my bike some guy from
Newcastle which is the northeast of
England it's this quite a poor town
there's a lot of workingclass people
there and um he said I've been watching
you on
YouTube and um I love your stuff and um
this guy started crying this guy start
crying on the street right in front of
me he's like I work so hard Gary I work
two jobs um my mom's sick and I'm trying
to help I'm trying to support and and I
don't understand why and and I'm sorry
that I'm
crying but nobody ever told me that it
wasn't my fault before that's what he
said to me okay and listen listen I
believe 100% aspiration ambition
entrepreneurial spirit I would never say
see a kid that has that and say turn it
off okay but the flip side of your if
you just work hard enough you can make
it is if you didn't make it it's because
you didn't work hard enough and it's
your fault and I would like you to sit
and think very hard before you send that
message to young men and young women in
our
society meritocracy doesn't mean that
everyone uh ends up with the same result
what what I'm trying to what here's what
I'm trying to achieve I'm trying to
achieve the people who have ambition who
can go for it are incentivized to do it
and incentivized to build jobs and build
companies about the ones that just want
to work hard and have a good family and
take care of them and have a home and be
able to turn the heating on and be able
to Financial Security they need to work
for business don't they they need to
work for you yeah P they need to work
they need to work for a business some
business right if someone doesn't create
that business then where do they work
for we now have by the way we now have
11% of 11% of working age people are now
declared too sick to work right we have
a huge problem in the UK we also have
25% of uh people who are working age
don't work uh it's one in seven men
don't work work at all do you think
they're lazy Dan I think the system is
collapsing do you think think the system
is average British American working is
lazy what I think is happening is that
the technology companies are totally
transforming and disrupting everything
um and what happened is around the
post-war era we had good jobs we had um
you could work in a local thing what's
happening now is that jobs are going to
the Philippines they're going to uh
techn technology does three things it
makes jobs more simple which makes them
replaceable
it makes jobs Global where you can move
them to anywhere else and then
ultimately it automates the job Al
together and gets rid of it uh through
code and software and what's really
going on in the last especially 5 years
since the pandemic is technology has
decimated the existing systems uh that
we all relied upon when we grew up and
when I say the uh education system isn't
really working it's still pretending
that there are office jobs available for
people when they graduate and it's still
pretending that there's like 1950
scenarios available when actually my
kids are going to be disrupted by AI
everyone's kids are going to be
disrupted by AI um you know these sorts
of things are the are the things that
really we we also need to be talking
about to all the founders and small
business owners listening I think you
need to hear this it's an update from my
sponsor Fiverr they've just launched
something called Fiverr go and in short
it's a huge game changer for you and
your team it's a tool that's been
created to help Freelancers train and
control a personalized AI tool specific
to them and in their style which means
that fiver Freelancers and their clients

categories and that number is growing
rapidly if it's something you'd like to
tap into head to fiver.com diary now and
explore fiveo use code diary for 10% off
your first order this is the moment
where AI superpower meets human talent I
I want to take this back to a point you
were talking about earlier which is
about personal agency because I would
like you Daniel to give the counter to
your own argument because I want to make
sure when we're talking about solutions
to this problem start a business be
entrepreneurial you can also understand
how that might that works for people
with our brains and our mindset and
whatever we had that made us do that our
risk appetite our trauma whatever it
might be but not everybody is wide in
such a way so that's not necessarily the
best solution for and also we sit here
with a bit of hindsight bias where we we
were lucky and it worked out for us but
when you look at the stats around
businesses succeeding what you know the
stat it's like 90% of businesses fail so
most of them are failing
the ones that emerge from that people
like me then we have a bias where we go
well it work for us you do it too I
don't come from money so I have the same
bias like I watched well I've I've built
I've built from scratch several times
because I got disrupted several times so
I've had to start with nothing several
times and build but you started type of
person right and when we say start from
nothing you actually started with a
wealth of information and the whole game
in building building Capital
intellectual Capital having been through
it before being around that Mentor that
gave you the information also having
access to a great market like having
access to a free market is is a big
thing I was born in Australia and I
moved to London at the peak of London's
economic freedom so this can't be
broadly applicable advice can it uh well
I think personal agency is broadly
applicable the idea I got this friend of
mine who woke up one day he went out
clubbing went out to a nightclub felt
sick collapsed woke up and they had
chopped off all four limbs right so uh
he had quadruple ampute um he was 19
years old so he wakes up in bed and he
basically says I'm a quadruple ampute I
was I was fine 48 hours ago and now I'm
a qu quadruple amputee and he decides to
make this decision in the in the
hospital room um that this is going to
be the best thing that ever happened to
him and he makes that decision right
even that is a consequence of his him
and his wiring what I'm trying to
understand but he ended up he ended up
starting a clinic and it's a
multi-million dollar Clinic I mean it's
incredible what can do the rule it's
incredible what people but you only need
a few people to succeed and the whole
economy starts to improve we we actually
in this UK we only at the peak of our
entrepreneurial like blitzing it where
we're doing so well there was only
40,000 scale UPS 40,000 companies were
creating jobs growth higher wages um
investment into the company into the
country you know it's only 1% of people
who pay 30% of the taxes and 10% of
people who pay 60% of the taxes so you
only need one in a 100 to actually
create something that's valuable and you
get an extra 30% of taxes but so so that
again is we need this one that advice
for the what the people that end up
getting into that 1% but who does
everyone else work for like all jobs
growth comes from entrepreneurs so what
are you saying to those the 199% there
are you saying go get a job well you you
need wealth creators in the economy who
are building something like you take um
gym shark people who work at gym shark
they're super glad that this guy started
the company they're really happy that
there's a company otherwise where would
they go what would they work where would
they work so if Ben decides that he
doesn't want to start that company in
the UK um or if he gets to 10 million
and
stops uh then all of those additional
jobs are are toast they're all gone so
you encouraging the entrepreneurial
you're not encouraging everyone to
become an entrepreneur you're saying
those that have those that bias or that
I'm saying we need a system that
encourages the people who can to do um
and what about everybody else well every
the flow on effect is that that creates
jobs that creates wealth in the economy
um and free markets lift everybody up
um free markets just means that
everyone's trading with everyone um you
know it starts to like the whole thing I
mean it's it's just a tail as oldest
time as soon as economies are free and
there are entrepreneurs starting things
and growing things everyone's life
improves everyone life get better um and
what's your what part of that do you
disagree with Gary I think it's it
doesn't work it doesn't work the only
period listen the last 70 years are not
normal Stephen the last 70 years are not
normal the last 70 years in Europe and
the US where ordinary people like my dad
could work for the post office on less
than average wage and buy a house and
support family it's not normal it's not
normal in the world and it's not normal
in history most countries in the world
do not like that most countries have a a
small Super Rich Elite and a very large
group of extremely poor people that's
most of the country and it's most of
history in this country and it's most of
history in the US you know yeah we talk
about Charles Dickens I read hard times
I read hard times and this is written in
the 19th century when Britain was like
the industrial super of the whole world
and at the time the government was
talking about should we tax these
industrialists and the industrialists
were saying if you tax us we'll throw
our factories into the sea and it just
reminds me you know the only time we've
ever really been able to provide decent
living conditions for ordinary working
people was the period after the war
where we massively redistributed wealth
and and now we're losing that that
holding of wealth in of the middle class
can you acknowledge though that that was
a completely different time as it
relates to being able to it was a
different time but you
I could you know of techy Nigeria today
Brazil today the UK 300 years ago France
200 years ago there is only one specific
time that we have ever successfully
provided broad living standards for
ordinary people and it was a period of
time we protected a broadly equal wealth
distribution and tax the rich at very
high rates and you can acknowledge that
that's extremely hard to do because the
nature of the economy 100% 100 that's
the reason why all of our grandparents
and our great-grandparents and our great
great grandparents lived in poverty and
that's why I know I'm probably going to
lose and that's why I bet on the economy
getting worse and that's why I know
poverty is going to increase because it
was extremely difficult to get the
unusually fair share for ordinary
working people and I know we're losing
the argument and I know that farage will
win and I know that Trump will win and I
know that and I know that things will
get worse I don't think I'm going to win
so if you if you know you're promoting a
a strategy that is not going to work and
it sounds like you think is
incredibly almost impossible then why
would you not be more practical in your
solution Stephen if it was impossible I
wouldn't be here think it's possible of
course it's possible of course it's
possible but you believe you're not
going to win I'm a betting man Steve I'm
a betting man I put my bets on you know
I am if I get okay look okay so my
YouTube channel is growing really really
quickly and you know I'm obviously like
starting a bit of a movement and there's
a lot of political support and if it
keeps growing we'll get more political
support at the end of the day I'm trying
to tax the richest and most powerful
people in the world and most of these
people will come out and attack me and
they'll try and stop me and I do not
have billions of pounds hundreds of
millions of pounds to use to support my
YouTube channel I'm counting on ordinary
people like your viewers to support and
share my message now listen for most of
history that has not worked and for most
of History ordinary families live in
poverty I don't think it's impossible
that we Ordinary People can win and get
a fair share but I think it's worth
fighting for Steve so I fight for it
anyway he's he's right that for most of
History you've had the super Elite and
then everyone else is down here and it's
massive wealth inequality is almost the
normal uh for the last five thousand
years and almost everywhere uh you've
got kings queens dukes and peasants and
surfs down there there have been
economic situations that have been
different uh Dubai is a really strange
situation it's a desert it's in
inhospitable to live in it's the last
place in the world most people would
think or choose that they would want to
be and yet it's one of the most
economically rich places in the world
right now they actually didn't start
with oil wealth they were able to borrow
money to build Dubai but the low tax
environment has now attracted raed some
of the world's most talented people to
go and build technology companies there
and if you I don't know have you been
there recently I've been to Dubai few
years AG now but I've been so at the
moment it is the most thriving
entrepreneurial community on Earth
outside of the US but probably even
rivaling the US that there are investors
there's entrepreneurs and the wealth is
going through the roof um I've got two
friends who are personal trainers
fitness trainers one fitness trainer has
decided to stop working uh more hours
because he's hit 50 Grand a year and he
now gets taxed at 40% so he's basically
decided he's going to earn right up to
50,000 and then stop working and then
the other fitness trainer went to Dubai
launched an online uh Fitness uh
community and has just bought a $350,000
Ferrari uh and one entrepreneur is super
pumped and super excited about building
a business because he's not over taxed
the other entrepreneur has literally
said I'm not willing to do this because
of how much I have to pay just want to
be clear I've always campaigned for
lower taxes on rich on working people
always always so but here's but here's
the thing right if I was ask you you've
just become one of the best selling
authors in the country if your publisher
came to you and said because you're in
the top 1% of our authors we're going to
Harve your royalties uh if you sign a
second book with us you wouldn't sign a
second book with them you go to another
publisher who says we'll pay you more
royalties because you're so successful I
would have written this book for free
then I would have written this book for
free in fact the first time I got off of
a deal I said I said don't pay me an
advance then give you royalties away why
well because if what I'm saying all
right fine I'll give my royalties away
I'll shut my YouTube channel down I'm
saying we respond to incentives that if
your publisher if penguin came to you
and said book number two you get half
royalties because you're in the top 1%
would you sign with penguin or would you
go someone El from a 2 million job a
year to run a YouTube channel do you
think I do the work that I do for money
I'm not talking about that you do it for
money I'm just saying if you had the
option to sign between two publishing
contracts right and all things being
equal one's going to penalize you for
being in the to 1% and the other one's
going to reward you for being in the top
1% would you you of course you would go
with the normal like if all things being
equal you want to write a second book
anyway it's the same for entrepreneurs
when entrepreneurs start companies we
can either start them in high tax
economies or with a stroke of a pen
start them in low tax I think the rich
world is going to have to start
rethinking the fact that it allows
people to very very wealthy people to
own enormous amounts of their physical
wealth go live overseas and not pay tax
I think that has to be Revisited for
sure because what you're saying is I
want the benefit of being able to sell
to the US market and the UK Market but I
don't want the obligation of having to
pay us and UK taxes and you are correct
that at the moment the US and UK
governments allow that and I think
that's US taxes you on worldwide income
well only a small amount right so I
think that realistically I think that
the US and UK governments have to stop
that but the way I see it the US and UK
governments and increasing a lot of
global governments are kind of being
bought up by the elites and you know we
have ELO musk is basically the President
right and we had richy sunak who father
was one of the richest men in the world
like if you're richy sunak who for our
American viewers was our prime minister
until very recently his father is one of
the richest men in the world he's got
700 million personal wealth he's going
to be making 3040 million pound passive
income and you're getting paid 130 Grand
de to be prime minister when you're
making policy do you think maybe I'll
ask my father-in-law at once you know
the fact is what you're seeing here is
if you allow the rich I'm I'm never ever
against entrepreneurship I'm not against
people getting rich if you allow the
rich to get richer and richer and richer
they squeeze the middle class and they
squeeze the poor class out of things
like housing of things like space in
cities of things like energy and of
things like owning a sharing government
and media do you acknowledge that
countries that adopt a anti-ri big
government approach tend to collapse
what like like this country in the
60s we needed a US bailout we needed an
IMF bailout in 1976 but the US did the
same thing the US had even higher taxes
than us we we basically like you take
you take all the countries that where
the government becomes big they meddle
with your life they're involved in every
decision right half the economy I mean
here's one other the things this period
is known as the Golden Age of capitalism
it's the period of time when which
period thisi 50 years off the second
world war oh it's the Golden Age of
middle class to be middle class you
don't care about the middle class no no
of course I do the the but the 70 years
after the World War II yeah where the
government sold off all of its houses to
middle class people so we got housing
wealth but you can only do that trick
once right so you can only sell off all
the houses to everyone once which is why
all the Baby Boomers own them well the
living s is collapsed after the houses
were sold there was a long period where
the houses weren't sold between the
second world war and the 80s pinpo
living standards collapsing well I think
there's a few obviously big moments I
think 2008 is a big moment I think Co is
a big moment I think it's the 80s where
you start to see the wealth distribution
go what matters is actually the
distribution itself so once you change
the tax system it takes a bit of time
for the wealth distribution to change
but once you start for me the big thing
is is the loss of wealth holding I want
ordinary families to be able to hold
wealth and once you lose that you lose a
middle class and you will not find me a
single country in in the world now or
the history of the world that has
provided good broad living standards
without allowing ordinary families to
own assets yeah I agree and take
Singapore for example where everyone's
encouraged to own properties they've got
an amazing system in Singapore they've
taken this a massive government by the
way enormous government 25% of GDP they
they own they own the houses they have a
weal f they own all the houses they
don't own all the houses they have a a
sovereign wealth fund that circulates
houses through they've they own the hous
they' solved they've solved Singapore
owns the house they own the Singapore
government owns an enormous share of the
houses so do you think we should own
pension Pension funds people uh they
force not force their citizens but they
uh direct their citizens into Home
Ownership you don't think Singapore and
government owns a large sh I just know
that the Singaporean government's only
25% of the economy but big sh of the
housing stock 75 the economy is I would
like to say by the way just to be really
clear I've never ever once advocated for
big government never a single time big
government I want higher taxes on the
wealth orders so we can tax wealth
creators and working people less I don't
want to Big A government I want our
viewers to have more money I want our
viewers to have more money and also I
want to tax those super rich so that
they stop squeezing ordinary families
out of asset ownership it just yeah it
see it it seems like an obvious solution
it seems like yeah it's good solution it
seems like like hey who's got the money
rich people not the money the assets the
asset who's got the assets rich people
then let's just take them off them and
no no no I don't want I don't want to
redistribute I'm I'm I am the only
person in this table anti-
redistribution because the
redistribution is happening in front of
our eyes the middle class is losing its
assets government is losing its assets
those assets are being accumulated by
the rich I want to stop the
redistribution please please I'm I am
the most anti- rist redistribution
person in this game we need to stop the
redistribu of wealth away from ordinary
British and American families so the
difference is for me it's very simple
which is I really truly believe that
free markets and low governments and
less taxes creates more wealth in the
middle and freedom for the Heron is
death for the fishes if we have complete
Freedom multi-millionaires like you and
me will get richer and richer and richer
every year and we will squeeze out and
we will eat the middle class ask you
though if wealth inequality could be
solved but everyone does worse is that a
good solu obviously not the whole reason
I do this because I don't want Ordinary
People toap into public this is about
people being able to feed their kids so
wealth inequality is not the problem
it's collapsing living stand that's
quite contorted I mean quite contorted
Logic the problem isaps living standards
I am somebody who has made millions of
pounds by understanding the simple fact
that living standards are falling
because of growing wealth INE equality
so living standards if they were to
increase but they were super rich yeah
is that a problem I think you do need to
be worried about us extremely wealthy
Elites yeah I think what's interesting
you look at the the founding of the
United States these guys the founding of
the United States conceptually is really
based on these ideas of distribution of
power that's why you have the president
and the house and the Senate and you
have this independent Judiciary they're
like we cannot allow power to become
concentrated because they came from a
Europe which had extremely concentrated
power and extremely wealthy Elites and
extremely broad poverty so I think that
allowing a small group of Society to
increasingly monopolize power and wealth
over time is obviously something we
should be worried about but primarily
the reason I worry about wealth
inequality is because I see and I bet on
and I make money on the fact that it
causes living standards to Fall by the
way I I actually really agree with you
and the founding fathers of the US they
did um especially around the 1900s they
did want to break up monopolies and
break up monopolies was one of the big
things that um they did trust busting uh
where they broke up Standard Oil and all
of those sorts of things one thing I do
really really see happening at the
moment is that we have a stupid outdated
definition of monopolies where we use
monopolies the same way they used it
when they had the oil uh companies that
owned all the oil in the technology
World a monopoly is formed through an
ecosystem so Amazon for example owning
AWS and Audible and this and this and
this and Whole Foods it creates a a
fortress that's almost impossible to um
to compete with and Google owning
YouTube and Gmail and all of this they
create these fortresses through
ecosystems one of the things that I do
think we need to look at is compulsory
breakup of big Tech once you hit a
certain time because it's very difficult
because do you know billionaires have
two big fears right keep them up at
night uh having nightmares number two is
high taxes number one is that startup
entrepreneur who disrupts their business
and they want to kill that early you
know Steve Jobs at 24 years old
disrupted IBM um and Jeff Bezos
disrupted Walmart so they are terrified
of entrepreneurs in the middle um and
they want to create government
regulations to say hey you know what
let's cap entrepreneurs at 10 million
you can get to 10 million it's okay for
us we're way past that point but Gary's
our guy because he's going to cap
everyone I never said cap anyone at 10
million by the way what do you think
will happen people stop as soon as you
have wealth taxes people just give up
they just don't want telling me our
viewers if if they said if they knew
they could build a 20 30 million SS
ridiculous they knew they would have to
pay 20 if you if you're if you're worth
30 million 1% above is 200 Grand a year
so if I said if you you can have a 30
million pound company TR just bear in
mind right you make 5% a year on your
wealth right so if you got 300 million
pound company you're going to be making
15 million pound a year and I'm turning
to you and I'm going to say you know
you've got to pay 200 Grand a year on
your 50 million pound revenue and
they're going to say you know what I'm
not going to start a business I don't
want to be worth 30 million quid this is
you know this is ridiculous you know
nobody is going to say oh my God I don't
want to be multi multimillionaire
because in 20 years time I'll have to
pay 1% taxes but most Traders most
Traders are earning what most people
earn in lifetime Traders can earn in a
year most Traders don't stop talk about
that a lot in my book right so most
Traders just keep going entrepreneurs
are the same that they're motivated to
keep going but when you have Wealth
Advisors and investors saying do not
build a company in the UK because
they're anti- wealth L I'm not trying to
make the UK anti- wealth I'm not trying
to make the UK and anti wealth I think
the UK and the US need to be looking at
a situation where you cannot allow
people who own enormous businesses that
sell to your country to live in Dubai to
live in the Cayman Islands and not pay
tax and I I don't think that's a
controversial position I've got a
question for both of you which is if you
are a young person and you're 18 years
old now and that you're listening to
this but your objective really is an
individualistic one you want to get rich
and you have a great future for you and
your family like all all of us have been
able to do what would your advice be to
them Gary at this moment in time this is
such a hard question I know Dan's angry
at me for what I put in my video how to
get rich um somebody came around to my
house and asked me this other day
obviously I get asked it a lot because
stupidly I'm very public about the fact
that I'm rich um what I did is not
replicable what I did is not replicable
it's not I'm sorry I'm sorry but it's
not people always say why don't you
teach me to trade like it's hard it's
hard trading and it's dangerous and I
think a lot of young men are getting
sort of sold into trading and becoming
gambling addicts um
you know work hard and I would I
wouldn't even say don't become an
entrepr I've never ever said these
things work hard you know if you think
that you have an opportunity in Tech
entrepreneurship go for it understand
it's risky I think that sometimes this
message just become an entrepreneur and
you make it is a bit dangerous because I
think most people who try to become
entrepreneurs fail and I think it's
super super dangerous the reality is and
you know maybe D like this maybe you
won't like this I think it is very very
difficult for a young man or a young
woman from a poor family to become rich
and I think it's increasingly hard even
to just get those basics of Financial
Security so listen obviously reduce your
spending if you can don't buy into this
like Balenciaga stay away from
that
but work hard study hard try to get a
good job but also understand we are
shrinking the seats on the Lifeboat
that's what we're doing we used to allow
50% to be secure then it's 40% then it's
30% then it's 20% you know you got
family in Nigeria if a young person from
like shanty town in Nigeria I came to
you and said Stephen what could I do to
get rich you would have to say to him
realistically listen you are in a
difficult situation here you need to
work really really hard but if you are
able to make enough money to to support
a family be proud of yourself what I
would actually say to them so yeah I
have got family in Nigeria um for people
that don't know I'm by Blood half
Nigerian I would say to them that
knowledge is really your life raft so
obviously there's a big Tech boom
happening in Nigeria which is liberating
a lot of people from that situation so I
would try and tell them to get on the
life raft that is like knowledge of this
new Revolution so from Nigeria you can
learn to code and then the the great
thing now is that we're we literally
have actually this is quite interesting
we're building a tech company in San
Francisco called flight cast it's live
everyone can go look at at flight.com
and the lead developer oh and guest
radar the lead developer of guest radar
is a Nigerian guy but how many of those
jobs in the Nigerian Tech sector are
going to kids that grew up in the shanty
towns I have no idea cuz I worked in
people ask me tell me how to do what you
did all right I worked in Canary Warf
it's in East London I could see the
building from my house going up there
was not a single other kid from East
London the whole time I was there do you
know to Dan's point about this remote
work Revolution where like work now has
you can work from anywhere and in our
company third web San Francisco me some
of the stuff that we now have are in the
Philippines because they just have like
great creatives there it's obviously
more cost effective isn't this a huge
part of what's going on in our economy
this this digitalization and this
remotify B your workers in the
Philippines very very well
um most of these people they used to
have a half decent wage on office and
now they're locked in their bedrooms
barely paying the bills yeah um in the
Philippines not in the Philippines the
Philippine guys are balling out control
no I'm saying the Philippines is booming
at the moment so you think the average
person in the Philippines is living a
luxurious life have you if you uh what's
happening at the moment do you think the
average person in the Philippines is
living a luxurious life there is there
is this thing called remote foreign
workers and this is a huge boom and the
economic the kidchen move to the
Philippines then it's great you get
great quality of life in the Philippines
you know when I looked at the thums of
Manila they should just get J they I
don't know why they're not getting the
laptops out uh the the poverty in the
Philippines is horrific I'm listen
Philippines a beautiful country an
amazing country I love the Philippines
number in there at at a rate that's
never what is the life like for your
average Filipino well would you agree
though that their economy is just
getting flooded with money at the moment
like money is flowing in there money is
flowing in but it is not giving a good
quality of life your average Filipino
that's not true remote foreign workers
well we can remote foreign workers
Filipino viewers to tell us
what's can actually support the often
support their en a look I don't know
what the average wages in the phili just
to bring it back to this point though so
I wanted to know from Gary he said work
hard if you're a young guy listening to
this now um I was reading this really
interesting article yesterday from the I
think it was from major newspaper
talking about the lost boys and it goes
to show that I think it's one in seven
young men that is at a working age now
are out of work so there's lots of talk
around young men in particular and how
they're struggling you'd say work hard
Gary You' say work hard no blena but the
big thing the big thing is recognize the
situation that you're in and I would
encourage them to support my work and
follow my channel because the lifeboats
are shrinking and trust me we're going
to get out kids in the lifeboats and we
all know that all right and if those
life boates are shrinking if you don't
if you don't stop the from going
down it is not you and you and me who
are going to go down we will be fine if
you don't fight the political fight I
guarantee you people like Daniel will so
you're saying that they should also get
involved in the political fight you have
to you have to that's what our
grandparents did Grand if they want to
become millionaires like you and me and
Dan well it sounds like Dan's got better
advice for that than I do okay well I'm
going to ask Dan as well but I just
wondering I'm wondering how your your
advice ties into sort of
like the young the young person who's
trying to liberate themselves from where
you came from or where I came from you
know what I don't think I'm the guy to
say that man because you know I had this
unusual gift from a young age I was very
very very good at maths and I just
followed that um and you know you know
my sister she's a poet and she wrote a
really successful Grime of musical about
DIY R's first album all right she comes
from obviously the same family as me
poor family she works so hard she works
so so hard two degrees she can barely
pay the rent all right so I don't want
to turn around to our young kids and say
well I've got this Talent follow your
talent because it doesn't work Stephen
true it doesn't work yeah wait my sister
does great work but financially for
young people following your passion
following your talent unless you come
from Rich family realistically very very
really works and I know it worked for
the three of us at this table but let's
not pretend that everyone experiences
the same things that we experienced what
would you say to that D and what's your
answer I think there's two economies
going on at the moment there's a dying
economy which is the Industrial
Revolution economy um and that is all
the office jobs and the factory jobs and
all of that sort of stuff which is very
much being automated away and moved
globally um and at the same time there's
this new bubbling up digital economy um
which I'd call the entrepreneur economy
or the digital economy um both of these
economies are kind of Co coexisting
one's going like that one's going uh
like that um and if you want to be
economically successful you need to
stand next to the biggest piles of money
that you can um you know unfortunately
being a poet uh doesn't pay a lot of
money and we all know that that's not a
surprise if you came from a very rich
family and you were a poet you'd
probably be one of the 60% who fell out
of a rich family uh as well um if you
want to be economically successful you
need to say what is the thing that's
economically booming right now Gary saw
the finance industry at that particular
time but if we actually look at the
finance industry now it's in Decline um
and trading is being rep uh replaced by
AI robots um people who worked in your
career are going to be replaced by uh it
systems that basically do similar jobs
it's going to be you know these things
happen we're going through a massive uh
technological change but at the same
time it's never been easier to learn
skills for free uh on YouTube it's never
been easier to join communities where
you can get mentoring and get support
there are communities of angel investors
who do invest in in startups uh it's
never been cheaper or easier to start a
company there's never been more software
and Technology to scale and grow you
know in just a in a short space of time
I would say do what Gary's done Gary
publishes online he's built a personal
brand he's attached it to a recurring
Revenue model uh he's got yeah I also
worked for three for free for four years
I'm not sure how replicable that is you
know so build a personal brand attach it
to a business model that is that is
where money is Flowing um these are
these are positive things you can do we
all have to play the cards we're dealt
you can always find someone who's done
better with better cards or someone
who's been dealt better cards and you
can always find someone who's been dealt
worse a cards no matter who you are on
the planet there's someone better
there's someone worse you have to play
the cards that you dealt you cannot sit
around waiting for the economic system
of the world to be changed you have to
say you know what these are the cards I
was born at this particular time in this
these circumstances these are my
strengths these are my weaknesses I'm
going to play the cards that i' I've
dealt um personal agency is what gets
people to feel good about their life to
make progress and as soon as you play
the victim mindset soon as you say oh
you know what the answer to all my
prayers is Gary's going to change the
system uh you're in serious trouble can
I just say one thing back on that um if
we become a society of of individuals
who think only individually and and
never consider broader societal problems
we will become a society that becomes
unable to fix societal
problems I'm somebody who has made
millions of pounds betting on the
collapse of society the collapse of the
middle class um I don't want to be
giving stock tips on the Titanic okay I
I understand I understand that we live
in individualized societies and and it's
not popular to say hey you need to
protect your Society um if you don't
protect your Society your Society is
going to collapse and and the British
public the American public have a choice
to make here here to protect these what
do you want people to do I want them to
get involved with watch my channel
subscribe to my channel content on
YouTube Instagram Tik Tok share it with
your friends share it with your mom
understand and then push for change push
for change like our grandparents did
push the politicians to tax working
people less and tax extremely wealthy
wealth orders more so vote for the
greens vote for whoever gives you that
whoever gives you your share of the PIP
basic listen this is not football okay
I'm not here M of the GRE I'm here to
protect the working class so that's
their sort of that would be their social
and sort of um political energy would be
to stand up and fight but in their in
their personal lives are you telling
them to start businesses take big risks
work really hard go for it because they
can also I would defer to you guys on
that you know I'm not a businessman I'm
an economist that's what I am you know I
made my money by being an economist I'm
a very very good Economist my
predictions will be right people can go
and watch my predictions at the
beginning of covid I predicted the
entire Co crisis exactly correctly in
May 2020 you know this is you know I'm
good at this I'm and listen I'm never
going to come here and say I'm a better
businessman than you and I don't I'm
pretty sure that I'm not I'm a very very
very good Economist this will happen is
there something that I can do if I'm sat
here listening at home I understand
everything you said I believe everything
you said I I I believe that it's going
to get worse for me do you think I
should still take responsibility of my
situation and fight to make my life
richer better moreful 100% 100 100% cuz
you you know and I'm sure you know if
you're average British or American if
you don't do that you're not going to be
able to turn the heating on you have to
do it you have to do it and I've never
once you I think my opinions are often
mischaracterized to being anti- ambition
you've read my book do you think I'm
anti- ambition no I work my tits off to
make money and I want every single young
person in this country to be able to
make money if they want to if that's
what they want to work towards but we've
created a society where it's almost
impossible for young listen I've been
there I've been at LC I've been at
Oxford I've been in the city I've been
in the media I've been in politics all
all of the guys at the top are a bunch
of Rich idiots we are not allowing these
smart kids from ordinary backgrounds to
get into those spaces why why do we
pretend we're not doing that do that I
disagree with that you're talking about
two types of elite spaces Elite space of
elite universities yeah and you're
talking about the elite space of
derivatives trading there's the real
economy yeah where entrepreneurs do
their work then there's the first
derivative which is the banking system
and then there's the second derivative
which is rates Traders like yourself
right these are these These are places
that normal people don't want to end up
most normal people who grow up in normal
households don't uh wake up one day and
say I want to be a rates Trader on a
double derivative of the economy making
bets most people want to start a
business that employs people and they
want to grow that business and be
successful do you think that starting a
business is a realistic High success
probability chance of ordinary poor
people becoming rich I I know that
economies Thrive when entrepreneurs are
active
and it's not just the entrepreneurs they
create is our viewers can do and most of
them will end up rich you only need 1%
to improve the whole economy there's a
really interesting stat that says
globally around 65% of ultra high net
worth individuals are
self-made approximately 19% primarily
primarily inherited their wealth and
about 16% inherited wealth but
significantly grew it through their own
Ventures so 65% of the ultra high worth
individuals globally are self-made does
that not mean that if I want to become
an ultra high Networth person it's going
to come down to listen we are just come
off the back of the golden age of
capitalism when ordinary people like my
dad you know I grew up in ilford it's in
East London it's a very immigrant area
most of my friends I grew up with come
from Pakistani Indian immigrant
backgrounds they come over with nothing
they worked really hard they made money
they had their own assets we had a
period where Ordinary People could make
money and could make wealth so obviously
we are now in a period where there are
rich people who made money during that
period but it's over now I'm seeing
ordinary people making money all the
time okay so you're telling our viewers
they're idiots why are they not making
money I'm not telling anyone they're an
idiot I'm saying that if it's that easy
okay all right fine go and buy Dan's
book read it and become a millionaire
because Dan thinks it's easy to become a
millionaire being an entrepreneur but I
suspect having not been an entrepreneur
that most of the people who've read your
book are not millionaires everything
you've touched has turned to Gold you
turned yourself to Academia you got an
amazing qualification you turned
yourself to banking you became 2 million
a year you turned yourself to being a
writer you become Sunday Times
bestseller you turn yourself to content
creating you get 800,000 followers and
you and now you sit there after all of
that evidence and say oh no it's all
over guys it's all I'm smart enough to
do it but you guys are not smart enough
to do if if you think you can teach
you've got your book if you think you
canach you say you're smart enough but
they're not smart enough I I wonder if
um we do have a bit of an education
problem at the at the heart of this
because I was thinking about your sister
and I was like right if I was the CEO of
Gary's sister what would I do there's
two things I do right now the first is
okay where's where what what Marketplace
is really valuing an ability to write
and write an impactful way I go write
you need to start an Instagram page
because I've seen what happened with J
sh this guy's pulling in tens of
millions a year because he took like you
know nice words that were motivational
poetic put them on there and I also
YouTube needs to get to YouTube because
if she can talk like you then she's
going to do exceptionally well on
YouTube as well um but the old there's
not going to be a great economy
necessarily for someone who's doing
poetry in many other places other than
one I'm saying is the internet but in
school we don't teach this there's no
YouTube class for YouTube and and it's
such a huge part of the economy I mean I
mean me and you have seen that it's
there's been this decentralization of
media where the megaphone was growing at
20% a year the me the megaphone was
people watching start a YouTube become
ENT it's the Internet isn't e I'm not
say works for most people stepen for
most people no it doesn't work it
doesn't work why are we pretending it
does but I what what I what I would say
is if in school we taught young kids a
couple new things and we stopped
teaching them about Pythagoras's Theorem
which by the way chat gbt is going to do
for you with your eyes closed and we
taught them about the new economy of the
internet about the ability to start a
shop and I it's crazy that I the school
system was designed in such a way where
they put me in exclusion unit because I
was so preoccupied with doing business
deals at school and my Headmaster came
on T National TV on what I lied to and
said yeah we unexp beled him eventually
because he made the school so much money
but the system was punishing me for
Entre for entrepreneurship and it wasn't
teaching me anything about the the new
economy which is which is technology St
do you think it matters if the
percentage of young people who are able
to Achieve Financial Freedom and have a
family is shrinking so do I think it
matters if the percentage of young
people that are able
to are you saying attain wealth and have
a family yeah Achieve Financial Freedom
and have a family I think that's a
really big problem listen I think that's
a really big problem I agree I know
listen and I know you've got this
podcast and I know you inspire young
people and I think that's a good thing I
think it's a good thing that you inspire
young people to go out and work hard and
try and Achieve something but I'm an
economist and what I see is the
percentage of young people who make it
shrinking and I think if you combine
those two things you reach a really
dangerous place because we go and tell
the young people it's there for you to
start a business and at the same time
the number of people who make it is 10%
5% 2% 1% and there will always be that
one person who makes it there will
always be that Steven Bartley in every
country in the world who's making it
through you know what I'm saying but the
systematic issue matters Stephen C can
we can we not change the education
system so that when I was 16 and they
threw me in the exclusion unit which
made me which would could so easily have
made me think that I was a failure
because my brothers who went Jason went
to LSC okay and became very much like
you and now works in my company um
managing my investments he in that
education system was rewarded so I sat
there as a kid thinking rich and
successful my older brother Jason
because he can do maths and I thought
I'm going to be a failure because I like
this thing called entrepreneurship and I
have ADHD so I can't pay attention in
lessons what I'm saying is if the
education system was designed in such a
way where people like me who were
entrepreneurial who were interested in
the internet and couldn't stop playing
video games were clapped for and said oh
my God double down on that yeah um I
think the net benefit when you think
about what the backbone of the economy
is which is entrepreneurs starting
businesses would be profound for this
country here yeah but that but but I I
think that I believe there needs to be
such a radical overhaul of our education
system if we want to stand a chance of
capitalizing on what the economy is
today yeah I I think I think you could
probably change the education system in
a lot of ways that could improve it but
you're kind of changing the education
system on the Titanic what my my
perspective is I can tell you with a
very very high rate of certainty if you
don't fix this problem of the wealth
being sucked out of the middle class 95
98% of people will be in poverty in this
country in 70 years I agree with you
this is the thing I agree that you can't
have a group of people at the very top
that own all the assets and all the
money or else I mean it's going to come
from somewhere and I remember the day
that I printed off the jobseekers
allowance form when I was stealing
Chicago town piz 10 years ago in my room
in Mosside in Manchester I remember what
it feels like to not have my parents
speaking to me to be have all these ccj
letters and baith letters on my desk and
really have no answer how how to get out
of the situation to the point that I was
like shoplifting I'd call the justy
driver and then trying to persuade him
just to give me the food that was that
was that was 10 years ago for me so I I
it's not I've not forgotten the the
those years of my life so I understand
what it is to be in that situation and
on an individual level I need need some
answers because I'm not going to wait
for these people in the
parliament to fix my life for me so I
need some individual answers and then I
do also care about the bigger picture so
I'm not like here as someone that just
wants to acrew loads of wealth myself of
course listen let's be honest no one
like there's not many human beings that
wouldn't like more money so I try and
acknowledge that bias but what I'm the
the the the big issue I have is is is
how and from my personal experience as
someone that now employs hundreds and
hundreds and hundreds of people here in
London up in Manchester in our offices I
there are a set of things that would
make me leave this country if it became
increasingly less uh friendly to
entrepreneurs I reckon if we come back
here in 5 years time I reckon I'll
employ 500 more people in the UK and
actually as you look around this room
you can see the age of them these are
young people yeah um there are things
you could do to make me not do that I
mean it's probably worth pointing out
that we're not taxing wealth and you're
leaving the country anyway Stephen no I
haven't left the country okay you're
going I'm I'm a tax resident here I pay
my taxes here and I have zero intent in
changing that I'm also on Dragon you
know so we're investing a lot of money
in UK businesses but listen I want to
raise I want to tax only high levels of
wealth only high levels of wealth and
listen don't get me wrong I understand
very rich people will complain and very
rich people will say just like they did
in Dickens I'm going to throw my
businesses I'm going to throw my taxes
my my businesses and my factories into
the sea Stephen your viewers are here
you listen Steven your viewers are here
you are a very wealthy person they are
are paying 20 30 40 50% you should be
paying your fair share Stephen you
should I think that I should
pay more tax especially when um I don't
think my kids should get should should
benefit from my wealth and maybe this is
a controversial opinion but I actually
don't I don't think I should be able to
pass down my assets to my children you
can't it's 40% tax I think it should be
more 4 yeah let's not pretend rich
people don't successfully pass their ass
their children I'm just telling you now
I do think I'd be robbing my children of
something from the background that I
came from if my CH my child gets
if my child has gets tens of millions
let's say even when I die I don't think
that should happen well I agree people
say when I talk about my sister people
like why don't you just give your sister
a load of money listen my sister works
hard she's a smart person she works hard
she produces good work I want to live in
a society where people like my sister
are able to support themselves with the
work that they do but we we're
destroying that Society who would pay
her the the customers you know this the
situ so you want her to start a business
she is a business yeah yeah and I want
people like her to be to be taxed less
so that what I want is ordinary working
people to be tax less so they have more
money in their pocket listen the reason
we had the thriving art scene in the 60s
is because we had a thriving middle
class that could go and buy the new
fashions and buy the new records and
then that created this thriving art
scene now we have a middle class which
is struggling to pay the bills so they
can't they can't buy stuff they you know
my syst makes theater shows the only
people who go to the theater are rich
people now but back back in the day you
know theater was something that was more
accessible you want you want the Arts
I've got to mate use a fashion designer
right nowadays there's all of the
business is super fast super cheap super
disposable fashion or unbelievably
expensive high-end because that's the
economy we've created I want you go to
Japan which is a less unequal Society
the restaurants are good quality
restaurants for ordinary people because
a good capitalist Society will produce
things for the people with money in the
case of theater where have the theater
consumers moved to where are they
getting their entertainment now well
what you have is a very rich group of
people who will still go to the theater
and they will pay a lot but then you
have a large group of people who are
relatively cash scarce and they will try
to get their entertainment in cheaper
ways of course you know what I mean
they're spending their time watching
your YouTube channel well exactly my you
which is Free by the way yeah but you
get paid from it you get the YouTube
Honest it's only in the last couple of
months that I started to make any money
because I don't do my own um editing so
and you I mean you'll know but in the
first few years you're paying yourself
to do it you know what I mean like I
think people some times massively
overestimate the amount of money this is
entrepreneurs entrepreneurs go through 2
three four 5 years worth of struggle to
get to the point where they're
successful and it feels pretty horrific
that you say oh finally when I make it
you take it um and then the advisers to
entrepreneurs just 10 million is quite a
lot of money so you know you can be
worth 9 million and not be paying
anything more but what if I just raise 1
million for investment into my company
but that then like I do if I'm if if I'm
raising money all the way along and my
investors are saying I'm sorry I don't
invest in the UK economy because it's
wealth taxes and all that sort of stuff
it's anti- wealth uh and then I just
have to move my company overseas well I
want to create a situation where the UK
consumer is so strong that you have to
invest in the UK you don't have to be
here to sell to
them if you're looking to take the next
step in your Tech Career you'll want to

Diego the Bay Area Toronto and around
the world head over to in
nitc careers to explore their
opportunities quick one I want to talk
to you about our sponsor whoop a
business I'm also an investor in and if
you follow me on Instagram you probably
noticed that recently I've picked up
running which I'm very much enjoying and
it started out as a challenge but it's
now evolved into something I do almost
daily it is one of those things that's
pushing me to be better every single day
but here's the thing to me progress
isn't just about pushing harder it's
also about training in a smarter way
which is where my whoop comes in whoop
doesn't just track my workouts it tells
me how ready my body is to take them on
before I've even started the workout a
few years ago we ran a study called
project p are and it found that Runners
who adjusted their training based on
their recovery scores improved their 5K
times by an average of 2 minutes and 40
seconds while reducing injury Risk by
over 30% and they did it while training
less so if you're looking for this type
of guidance when it comes to your
training head over to join. woop.com CEO
and get a 30-day trial with zero
commitment that's join. woop.com
CEO let me know how you get on so so do
we all agree on this premise though that
Gary's saying which is the very the
ultra Rich which we can classify as
being worth more than you're saying we
say 10 10 million is the line that we
campaign for okay we we think that they
should pay a greater share of the tax
and then the qu if you agree with that
premise the question then becomes yes
but how yeah well they already do 1% pay
30% I want to be clear that's the top 1%
of taxpayers which is not the top 1% of
richest people mind you I'm also not
necessarily saying um what's fair I'm
saying what's practically possible right
so like you could you could come up with
the world's most Fair on a back of a
napkin this is what's fair but whether
you can implement it is a very difficult
thing the problem is wealth is
completely mobile now it's really you
can live work from
anywhere the houses Dan yeah it's land
is that mobile you going rip you can't
rip the country out of the out of the
sea there's very few I've never met any
seriously wealthy people who own a lot
of houses you honestly think that the
entire housing stock of the UK is not
valuable yeah no it is but 78% is owned
by Baby Boomers they just own they've
they've bought a house in 1992 they own
the house personally I think that that
house ownership especially when you
consider mortgages is relatively
unequally distributed that is by the way
the most equally distribut young people
have now had the commercial property the
land the natural by Pension funds so
you're the viewers own it do they no
they're owned by if they own a pension
fun most of those commercial what the
distribution of Pion what is the
distribution of Pensions what percentage
of Pensions is owned by top 1% the I
wouldn't know off the top of my head but
with pensions but I know I know that OB
obviously wealth concentrates at the top
but here's the one thing keep in mind
wealthy group are not necessarily a
static group there was a study of the
richest people in 1900 and most of those
families are poor today or they they've
gone down in value today uh if the
richest people in 1900 had have just
simply kept their wealth there'd be
16,000 more billionaires but but they
they don't um you know in Wealth
Management in Banks yeah they have this
thing called the um succession planning
so succession planning is where they try
and figure out how to not to screw it up
across generations and they're they're
notoriously bad at it it's very hard to
keep wealth in Generations down in the
20th
century we had two world wars and a
holocaust that redistributed
wealth I would prefer not to have that
again yeah yeah yeah I'm with you I want
a affluent middle class I I really do so
where's the we going to come from you
want to just you're going to create your
entrepreneurs
entrepreneur entrepreneur economies that
are friendly towards wealth creation and
Entrepreneurship was the last time you
had a government that wasn't let's grow
let's grow let's
grow it's not working for the people
Daniel no the problem is is that they
need to step back they need to let
shrink let shrink let shrink our viewers
should keep close ey on Donald Trump and
Elon Musk because they're doing what
you're asking it'll be interesting to
see what happens right it's too soon to
tell if you were trying to grow the UK
economy would you not take America
approach because they seem to be much
more successful at growing growing their
economy I think I mean of course when we
talk about slashing of the state they're
going to use these examples like oh
there's this wasteful government
building everybody wants to slash
government waste of course I'm not going
to fight against slashing government
waste um I'm from the UK you know I saw
the austerity years I've seen what's
happened to local Services I've seen
what's happened to things like the
police like like education you know
especially things like Youth Services um
you slash the state you fire a load of
people you know
what does the state okay yeah if you can
get rid of State corruption yes 100% if
you can get rid of State waste 100% you
know this is how single moms feed their
kids
Stephen you want to stop that no I'm
saying that slashing the
state I don't think it's going to work
um to be honest I think tariffs is is
not an uninteresting discussion I think
yeah of course tax avoidance is
something you need to get rid of really
I would like to take a step back look at
the country and say what is the state of
the country what what the people need
you know we have a country here where
the housing stock is falling apart and
we're letting it fall apart because
those houses are owned by ordinary
people who don't have any money if you
want the country to work for ordinary
people you need Ordinary People to have
money I'm always reminded of Mr Beast he
goes to places in Africa and he spends
500 quid and he gives a kid eyesight who
would have been blind for the rest of
their life for 500 quid why are kids in
Africa blind who could be given sight
for 500 quid because they don't have any
money this is what happens when you
drain your middle class you this will
end up like that you know you know I've
got a friend who went to India last week
he said there were people lying on the
street outside with rotting limbs you
know that is what happens when you when
you disempower when you take the money
away from your middle class you've got
to protect the middle class if the
middle class had money then there would
be unbelievable business opportunities
for selling goods and services like your
business to the middle class so would
you tax Daniel more
I don't know if Daniel's worth more than
10 million pounds it sounds like he is
um is I mean I think I want to make it
clear right you people you make 5% on
your wealth so if Daniel's worth 100
million he's making £5 million we're
only trying to tax you 1% I think if you
are worth 100 million you're making 5
million pound passive income you can
afford to pay a million pound tax a year
you're going to still keep getting rich
the truth is even if we were to tax
these billionaires 1% a year they would
still squeeze the rest out this is not
this is not about morality this is just
cold hard economic analysis that I have
made a lot of money betting on so
closing arguments then chaps um I'll
start with you Gary based on everything
we've discussed today um what is I'm
going to ask you to to give me two
perspectives which is if I'm a young
individual in this country right now
what should I do to protect myself and
my family and to feed my family what
kind of behaviors what strategy should I
drop there but also then from a
government level I know we have some
politicians that listen because they
message me what should politicians be
doing to to fix the issue that we're all
clearly identify which is the collaps of
the middle class the collaps of sort of
working-class people and the the the
increased wealth of the rich I think
what I would like young people to
understand is that this gets worse this
getss much much worse it will get much
worse um relatively quickly uh poverty
will increase relatively quickly it will
become
increasingly difficult almost impossible
to make any serious money prepare
yourself for that prepare yourself when
you consider your finances when you
consider your plans for having a family
um
this gets worse and it's going to be
really really hard it's going to be a
big mental health problem for a lot of
young people um so speak to people and
understand that um my YouTube videos are
there G's economics people don't
understand what's happening um after
that you've got to do all the right
things yeah I mean I don't disagree with
you you've got to work hard you've got
to study the right things um I I think
it's a great shame we have made subjects
like the Arts um a thing which you
you're not allowed if you come from po
poor backgrounds you cannot work in arts
I'm sorry you can't pay the bills you
can't so you have to go and study Ai and
Computing and you know maybe social
media although we have to be honest
social media doesn't pay for most people
um you have to realize the reality of
your situation it's very very very very
bad that doesn't mean you don't work
that doesn't mean you don't Aspire you
work damn hard because you have to but
if you manage to make enough money to
even support a family you should be
proud of yourself that that's the number
one thing um but
recognize this can be changed this can
be changed our grandparents our
great-grandparents fought for our
biggest share of the pie and they got it
they got Healthcare they got education
they got housing they got food our young
people can have that as well but they
won't get it unless they fight for it so
I would encourage people
to educate themselves support my work
get involved politically but also work
hard support your friends and family try
and make money because you'll have
to if you don't play politics I
guarantee you the other side will play
politics and that means your kids and
your grandkids live in poverty so you
have to do both with regards to
politicians um I got mixed feelings
about a lot of politicians the truth is
I think a lot of politicians are very
rich and and ultimately they don't care
they're protected a crisis of inequality
looks fantastic from the top and I think
that's why the three of us can sit here
and say things will be fine because for
us they will be fine and for our kids
they will be fine but for our viewers
kids they won't be fine um the
politicians are not going to try and
save you I'm going to try and make sure
they do it but I don't think they will
listen my plan is not to get concessions
from politicians my plan is to get 5
million followers on the internet and
Bully the politicians so that they have
to give us what we need so I would
support people to get behind me get
behind my campaign but also understand
what's happening educate your friends
and your family and just crucially to
understand this is going to be a long
fight so be strong keep your people
around you but be ready for what's to
come I am I see hint and some of the
things you've said recently of you going
into politics yourself at some point
Stephen I'm in politics but I me
politics actively listen I I do not want
to be an MP I do not want to be
Chancellor I do not want to be prime
minister if we get to a point where I
feel that that is something that is
achieved when is the best way to fix
this problem I will be open to it this
is not plan a this is not you know would
you like to be prime minister I suspect
probably not right like this is I'll be
honest I I am quite uncomfortable with
even the level of um public profile that
I have at the moment which is you know
it's much less than what you have but it
stresses me out and it's weird we spoke
about it before we were shooting um I
don't want to can you imagine I I don't
want to be prime minister I don't want
to be an MP um but I'm serious about
this work that I do and if we reach a
point that I think that is the best way
to do it I will consider it but I would
much rather be able to influence the MPS
from the sideline to influence the
politicians from the sidelines and for
that person you just gave advice to who
should they be voting for well we don't
have an election for listen
politics is not football politics is not
football okay this is not about I'm
labor I'm conservative I'm Republican
I'm Democrat you're losing your houses
here you you're losing your houses your
kids will be in poverty and you're going
to see both Trump and the Republicans
and Karma and labor who are supposed to
be on the opposite side of the political
spectrum they will both fail because
they will not take action on growing
wealth inequality and I'll be right on
that you know bring me back in a few
years I'll be right on that and um that
shows you it's not about I think this
factionalism is unbelievable damaging to
our societies especially in the US where
there's so much hatred behind it where
suddenly I'm on this side you're on that
side we're going to shake hands after
this nothing we will you know it's
there's no hatred here but if you allow
yourself to be divided from half of your
country and you allow we're seeing it
growing tensions racial tensions gender
tensions if you allow yourself to be
divided they will win they will win so
you need to vote for whoever is going to
protect your houses and if you want to
know who that is come and check Gary's
economics before the election and I will
tell you who it's going to be
Daniel nice closing arguments personal
and social a a few things um I read
Gary's bookin it's brilliant and
regardless of um regardless of whether
you actually like economics it's a
brilliant story it's a really I read it
in about two or three days um and it'll
it'll eventually be a good movie as well
um I agree with a lot of what Gary's
saying um there is a collapse of the
middle class uh and it probably will get
worse uh and the traditional middle
class jobs that came out of the back of
the Industrial Age mature Industrial
Revolution system th those are
collapsing and it's globalizing we're
seeing technology move opportunities all
over the world um and wealth inequality
it has a cause uh wealth inequality
itself is a scoreboard and there's a
cause for what led up to wealth
inequality and the cause in my mind is
technology technology is moving the
those opportunities around and it's
changing things we already have big
governments we have huge amounts of
taxes we're at record levels of tax taes
um uh wealth has never been more mobile
it's not about what's fair it's about
what you can practically get away with
it's about what you can actually
Implement um and uh it's going to be
very very as Gary said it's going to be
very very very hard to tax people who
have digital businesses who can live and
work from anywhere I know that firsthand
um that it's incredibly mobile with that
said at a micro level oh sorry at a
macro level big picture we do know that
there is a correlation between economic
freedom where the government gets out of
your way and low poverty rates and we
know that as soon as governments become
big uh high taxes High regulations it
actually drops down a category and we
see poverty goes up from 10% to 30% so
triples um so constricting economic
freedom is never a good idea uh if you
look at the data at a micro level
there's never been a greater opportunity
for anyone who's ambitious and
entrepreneurial to go and start a
company it's cheaper than ever to start
a company you can do what Gary's done
which is publish content build a
following uh figure out how to monetize
it uh you can create products and
services and sell them to anywhere in
the world um you're an example of
someone who started with nothing and
became a millionaire in your 20s and
then again in your 30s with a completely
different thing he became a millionaire
in his 20s and then again in his 30s
is's a bestselling author and a content
creator I did it in my 20s my 30s and
now my 40s um starting from scratch so
it's it's not normal that three guys our
agage could have done that over and over
again it's because we are living in a
time where there is incredible
opportunities but you have to be tapped
into those opportunities you never heard
about it at school you never heard about
it at University you're going to have to
learn the skills to get tapped into
those OPP opportunities but there are
definitely ways that you can succeed in
the world that we're living in and on
that macro Point who should we be voting
for because some of your thinking in
policy suggestions through this
conversation align more with Trump Elon
the American Mission now where they're
welcoming millionaires they're trying to
create a really entrepreneurship
friendly environment they're doing the
Doge dismantling of sort of government
waste I I agree with Gary it's not
football you don't have a team you swing
you should be a swing voter you should
vote every single election you should
make them work hard for your vote and
you should is Trump going to succeed
though you should see it's too soon to
tell but he made a prediction so I'm
inviting you to make a prediction he
said five years time we come back here
we're going to see that Trump I think I
think a lot of very wealthy people are
going to move move to the USA um you're
going to get a lot of people from all
over the world he's playing to win and
he wants rich people and entrepreneurs
and investors to come into the US and be
based there he's creating golden visas
and open visas and the success metric
here is the middle class get richer and
more affluent what I actually think will
happen as a result of all of that you
will see Rising living standards in the
USA and you'll see a detriment to the
places where those people live it's not
a good thing to have the people who pay
the majority of the taxes which is 1% of
people paying 30% of taxes if those
people leave the bills get spread across
everybody else well we'll have to do a
part two and we shall see um I want to
thank you both for the work that you do
because I'm a big fan of both of you I
watch Gary's videos all the time helps
me to understand another perspective on
what I'm typically hearing out out on
the Internet or that I hear on Twitter
about what's going on in the world and I
think I really respect and admire people
that can do what both of you have done
today which is to exchange and listen to
ideas in the pursuit of answers uh and
that's why I'd highly recommend anybody
regardless of whether you agree with
everything or some things or or or just
a little bit to go and follow Gary's
Channel on YouTube called Gary's
economics because it's a great source of
information from someone who has done it
from understands the world from another
perspective but also someone who's
providing a narrative which I actually
think there's we kind of talked about
before you started there's a big gap in
the market for there are a lot of people
like me and Dan out on the internet that
are talking about entrepreneurship and
finance and how to make money but there
aren't enough people talking about
wealth inequality from the perspective
as Gary sees
um and that are providing more sort of
uh collectivist and sort of society
wide Solutions and answers and sort of
explanations as to why that's ultimately
happening I do think I do think because
I know you Dan I hope I know myself I do
think that we we all want the UK to
survive and I think we all believe that
the way that the UK survives isn't
necessarily a couple of ultra rich
people getting more money it is sort of
social mobility and it's allowing people
that are at the very bottom to create
opportunities and to succeed we all
agree upon that even if we agree
disagree sorry on the causes and the
solutions to that um I'd also highly
recommend everybody to go check out the
trading game because everybody's talking
about this this book and I think it's
what four weeks at the moment on the
Sunday Times besteller list four weeks
number one number one four weeks number
one which is an incredible achievement
but it speaks to what's in this book the
way that the story is told but also the
timeliness of this message so I'd highly
recommend everybody to go check it out
I'm going to put a link below so that
everybody can go and do it and if you
just look at some of the um the the
testimonials for this book it's profound
I hear people describe it as like
Unforgettable on one end and then sad on
the other end because that's the nature
of the reality it speaks to and I highly
recommend everybody to go check out Dan
priestley's entreprene Revolution but
also your website has all of your
resources and tools on it so I'll link
that on the screen what's the uh Danel
priest.com Danel priest.com thank you
both for your generosity really really
appreciate it thanks for bringing us
together no matter where in the world it
seems like everyone is drinking matcha
and there's a good chance that that
matcha you're drinking is made by a
company that I've invested more than
seven figures in who are a sponsor of
this podcast called perfect Ted because
they're the brand used globally by cafes
like blank Street Coffee and Joe and the
juice and many many more not only can
you get perfect Ted match in cafes but
you can now also make it at home much
cheaper in seconds using our flavored
matcha powders that I have here in front
of me perfect Ted matcher is ceremonial
grade and source from Japan it is smooth
it is naturally sweet not like those
bitter grassy matches that I tried
before perfect Ted and if you are one of
those people that have told yourself you
don't like matcha it's probably because
you haven't tried our perfect Ted matcha
and you can find perfect Ted matcha in
the UK and Tesco sainsbury Holland and
Barett and in waitrose or Albert Hine if
you're in the Netherlands and on Amazon
in the USA or'll get the full range

I'm I'm sick of multi-millionaires.telling kids who can't afford to turn.the heating on you just need to be more.entrepreneurial it's sick Dan it's sick.well your video where you talk about if.you don't have a rich dad you're screwed.well to me if I had have come across.your content at 19 20 years old I would.have been screwed my friends can't feed.their kids okay if it was that easy why.is everybody not doing it I'll tell you.why people aren't doing it it's because.you like to say one thing back on.that today's debate is fiery to say the.least but important nonetheless as I sat.down with two leading experts in wealth.and Entrepreneurship and the economy to.discuss the state of the US the state of.the UK and the Western World do you.think the reason the average Brit.American are getting poorer is because.they don't know how to create wealth no.the reason people are getting poorer is.because of big governments record levels.of taxes an outdated schooling system.technology and remote working you sure.about that how do you disagree with.those opinions living standards are.falling because of growing wealth in.equality if you allow the rich to get.richer they squeeze the middle class and.the poor class out of things like.housing let's cut tax on people who are.working hard and let's raise tax on the.richest and most powerful people in the.world that's an overly simplified view.of things we now have a th000.millionaires a month leaving which means.every ordinary person who pays 10 grand.a year in tax will now have to pay 20.grand a year in tax you end up cutting.off your nose to spite your face if we.are a country that don't try and do.things which are necessary because they.are hard then our kids will live in.poverty what do you want people to do.there's a lot of different ways Backle.up this has always blown my mind a.little bit 53% of you that listen to the.show regularly haven't yet subscribed to.the show so could I ask you for a favor.before we start if you like the show and.you like what we do here and you want to.support us the free simple way that you.can do just that is by hitting the.Subscribe button and my commitment to.you is if you do that then I'll do.everything in my power me and my team to.make sure that this show is better for.you every single week we'll listen to.your feedback we'll find the guest that.you want me to speak to and we'll.continue to do what we do thank you so.much.Gary.Daniel Daniel you've been on the show a.few times before so I want to start with.Gary and understand a little bit about.your backstory and who you are and.having been through the trading game and.read and watched many many of your.videos over time I have a a sort of deep.understanding of that but for anyone.that doesn't know you can you give me a.picture of the context that um has.brought you to where you are today.writing about the things you're writing.about today and running the YouTube.channel and speaking to the subject.matter that you're speaking about today.take me right back and give me as much.as you possibly can okay so my name is.Gary Stevenson uh I was born in a place.called ilford which is in outer East.London quite a poor family little.Terrace House by the railway you know.playing football in the streets kind of.stuff.um always very good at maths since I was.a kid very talented Master student.eventually able to get into the London.School of Economics which is an.extremely Elite University economics.University in the center of London which.is basically a kind of investment.banking boot camp got a job as a Trader.started working full-time as a.short-term interest rates Trader at City.Bank in London in June.2008 when I was 21 obviously yeah.exactly that's just before the big.credit crash the big Leman crisis and I.watched the Leman Crisis happen in front.of my eyes I was um short-term interest.rate trading is basically like.short-term loans and during the credit.crisis what credit crisis is is nobody.can borrow any money so like short-term.loans become really really important.important my desk which was like.historically an unfashionable area of.trading became like the center of the.crisis or one of the centers of the.crisis people started making tons of.money um I was working with all these.crazy people and you can imagine me like.I turn up 21 years old and then like.within three months like everyone around.me is making a ton of money during the.credit crisis but what really interested.me was what happened after the crisis.itself which was so we're betting on.interest.rates long story short interest rates.come down when the economy is weak and.they go up when the economy is strong or.when the economy is overheating from an.inflation perspective in 2018 all the.interest rates go to zero so suddenly.our job is basically predicting and.betting on when will those interest.rates go back up which is when will the.economy recover and this is super.interesting right in.2008 because all the interest rates went.to zero so quickly like before 2008 it's.important to remember rates would move.from like five and a half to five and a.quarter and then here in 2008 everywhere.in the world slashing to zero Bo half a.percent exactly and everybody all the.economists were like wow this is going.to cause a massive recovery because they.thought that interest rates were.powerful and everybody predicted that.rates would come back up in 2009 which.of course we knowed they didn't then.everybody predicted that rates would go.up in 2010 which we now know they didn't.and then at the beginning of 2011.everybody was predicting rates would.definitely go up this year and this to.me was so interesting so interesting.because you know I studied master and.economics at one of the best economics.universities in the world and now I'm.working with these traders who are.getting paid millions of pounds a year.million pounds a year to predict the.economy to predict the interest rates.and everybody is wrong year after year.after year and this.was I was so amazing to me for a couple.of reasons first of all it's like wow.like this is a big thing that we as a.society should understand and like we're.getting it wrong but secondly.if all of the best guys in the world are.getting this wrong then if I can figure.this out I can make a ton of money here.G how much money did you make for City.Bank at the age of 24 years old that.year so that year 2011 I put this big.bet on that it would get worse forever.and I was City bank's most profitable.Trader in the world that year and I made.them just over $ 35 million you made.them $35 million you eventually decide.to leave City Bank yeah why.I mean I think that's an interesting.question right you know in the sense.that I've just explained to you what.happened which is I made a ton of money.by betting on the collapse of Western.Society uh I did it in 2011 I did it.again in 2012.um I would prefer for it not to collapse.step and I'm trying to stop it from.collapsing when you say it collapsing.what exactly you're referring to that.you you don't want to.collapse so you you born in Botswana.right yeah do you still have family.there um I've got family in Nigeria.which is where my my family are from I.was born in Botswana because we were.visiting there but got family in Africa.do you go to Nigeria much no I I've got.home in Cape Town in South Africa so I.see the it's a great place if you want.to see inequality I think there.is a naivity in in in this country in.places like the US that the kind of.inequality the kind of broad poverty.that you see in places like South Africa.in places like Nigeria in places like.India can't happen.here it will happen here that is the.future of this country that is the.future of the US and I'm not just saying.that I'm betting on it and I've been.betting on it for 15 years and I've been.right for 15 years that is what I'm.trying to avoid.Daniel where did you come from yeah so I.grew up in Australia um and I was born.to low-income family I grew up in a.place that had 24% Unemployment uh.pretty much the only jobs or.opportunities around me were things like.uh the trades building construction Pest.Control um hospitality and tourism um so.uh at 14 I got a job at McDonald's and.then I'm got a job in a bar and Pizza.Hut delivery driving and I discover.entrepreneurship so I discover books.about entrepreneurship and I discovered.that some people make millions similar.to yourself you saw Canary WF I read a.book about business ownership and as we.sit here today can you give me the.overview of your business success since.then yeah so I now have a group of.companies that I've either started or.bought um there's I've just sold a.company so there's seven companies in.the group um I've started a couple of.software companies one of our companies.is now the fastest growing one of the.fastest growing companies in the UK um.we you know we're a software business uh.I've got a couple of agencies I've got a.Education and Training business and.where when you think about the UK and.broadly the Western world today.what is your assessment of where we're.at as a country and what's concerning.you because Gary expressed quite.articulately that his big concern is.that because of wealth INE equality.we're going to end up in a similar.position to the likes of India what are.you concerned about I agree that it.wasn't that long ago that we had real.serious wealth inequality in this.country there are amazing photos from.like a 100 years ago of kids working in.mines and kids doing oyster shocking and.all this horrible work and um you know.there's a there's a book Charles Dickens.wrot wrote called The Tale of Two Cities.and the opening line of the book is it.was the best of times it was the worst.of times and I think we've actually.gotten to that point here where some.people in the UK it's the best of times.if you uh like in your situation you're.you know you're booming you're a.globally successful business um I've got.a globally successful business and then.there are a lot of people who completely.cannot relate to this their you know.Energy prices are now the most expensive.in the Western World house prices are.completely unaffordable it used to be.used to take 3 years to for a deposit.it's now 20 years if you you know.theoretically 20 years if you can save.for a deposit food prices are through.the roof so we're we're in a really diff.like for anyone who is not tapped into.digital economy fast growth and all of.that sort of stuff life is getting.harder and worse um and things are.collapsing um if you if you would um go.with that the there is a predictable.path countries go on and there's this.thing called the economic freedom index.and the economic freedom index basically.says how economically free are you how.how much access do you have to free.markets um do can you start a business.can you scale a business um does.anything inhibit your ability to run.your own life countries that have high.degrees of economic freedom have very.low poverty they have widespread.affluence and countries that have low.economic freedoms have high poverty and.it can be the difference between less.than 10% right up to 70% poverty rates.um and when countries go on a path.towards economic freedom poverty just.drops so India for examp example has.been on that path and they announced.today that they've almost eradicated uh.abject poverty or extreme poverty um the.UK went on that path of low economic.freedom to high economic freedom and we.saw poverty rates come right down but in.2008 when the global financial crisis.happened one of the things that happened.is the government said we need to step.in and we need to take charge and.everyone said please do um so they came.in and they said all right we're going.to ramp up debt ramp up taxes uh to pay.for the debt and we're also going to put.it all regul in and unfortunately that.starts to reduce economic freedom then.the pandemic happens and they say oh.we're going to spend more money again.through debt we're going to have more uh.taxes more regulations less economic.freedom so the UK we went from an 82.when I arrived in 2006 went from 82 out.of 100 down to 68 out of 100 so we're.less economically free and predictably.what we will always see happen if you.lower people's economic freedom more.poverty.uh less affluence uh the Millionaires.and the wealth creators leave uh the.people who are stuck in um dead end jobs.uh or no jobs get incredibly frustrated.everyone starts looking for someone to.blame people are angry and they're like.who do we blame and who do they blame.it's very different because in the US we.blame us blam someone different to the.UK so we have a historical cultural.memory in the UK we have a cultural.memory that the people to blame are the.rich so so uh we have landlords and uh.aristocracy and the landed gentry those.guys are to blame right so blame the.rich is what we say in the UK in the US.they have a very different view their.cultural memory is that they're.anti-government they want limited.government in 2023 there was this song.that came out called uh rich men north.of uh Richmond and it was the number one.song in America and the lyrics of the.song basically says people in Washington.do not care about working people um they.ATT taxing everything we touch you can't.earn money they depreciate the dollar um.they tax tax tax tax tax and they want.to control Our Lives those are the.lyrics of the songs controlling our.lives and taxing us so the American uh.reaction to this is who's to blame.government so we want smaller government.we want a department of government.efficiency to come in we want someone as.a wrecking ball who will come in and.smash government the British instinct is.hate the rich it must be the Rich's.fault so when we look for like all all.of the Western countries that.implemented lower economic.freedoms created more poverty less.affluence and more disruption to their.economies so both us and UK for example.and Australia as well but both sides of.the pond want someone to blame it's just.that the Americans blame government and.we blame the rich Gary I'm sure you you.have a lot to to say there I know you.both use the word collapsing so you.agree that there's a problem here but I.think you from studying both of your.sort of perspectives you think that this.the solution and the cause of the.problem is different I mean I put bets.on I put bets on I put bet that's what I.do I put bets on um at the beginning of.covid we knew the government was going.to give enormous amount of money out um.total amount of money now UK government.deficit since the beginning of Co is is1.trillion pounds US number is $4.trillion that's you know £20,000 per UK.adult.my background is I understand that when.the distribution gets worse when.inequality gets worse living standards.full so when when the UK government was.going to give a trillion pounds out all.I wanted to know was who's going to end.up with that money that's all I wanted.to know and um I mean the US number 13.trillion 14 trillion is just outlandish.but I think the most amazing thing I've.ever seen in my whole.life was that at the beginning of Co the.very beginning of Co we knew governments.across the world we're going to be.giving out tens of trillions of pounds.dollars.Euros nobody even thought to ask who's.going to get tens of trillions richer.nobody in the conservatives nobody in.labor nobody in the Republicans nobody.in Democrats nobody in the media nobody.in Academia nobody the central banks.nobody asked this it's.it's it's it's almost beautiful it's.it's unbelievable it's unbeliev so I I.sat down and I did I did the analysis at.the beginning because lockdown is.essentially Banning the spending of the.rich.and replacing that spending of the rich.with printed money from government what.happens is the government gives workers.money they use that money to pay their.bills to pay their rent pay their.mortgage it goes to the rich the rich.can't spend it because they're locked.indoors and what you get is essentially.an enormous amount of money from the.government to the poor to the rich and.this massive massive transfer of wealth.um that was obviously going that was so.obviously going to happen at the.beginning of Co nobody discussed it.which I think is itself.amazing let me ask you a question right.if we were now to pause the economy for.2 years and during that pause massively.increase wealth inequality what do you.think would happen to Broad living.conditions when we.unpaused see one of the things that I.think happened during the pandemic is.everything went digital and um.entrepreneurs and investors did actually.think about what would happen the.investors immediately boomed stocks like.zoom and uh Microsoft and we ended up.with the Magnificent 7 um I don't know.if you you know there's seven big tech.companies in the USA market and those.big seven companies have gone from five.trillion valuation to 17 TR trillion.valuation uh in the time of the pandemic.and if you think about what did the.pandemic do uh everyone had to work from.home so we all had to have Microsoft.subscriptions everyone went onto website.so we all went to AWS uh Amazon we all.started buying and learning how to buy.from Amazon rather than buying from from.our local high streets every business in.the world figured out how to run their.business remotely uh we had this massive.transformation it wasn't it was like.it's actually a wholesale transformation.of society that we all learned how to.live and work differently um I saw a.boom in entrepreneurship so what I saw.as an entrepreneur accelerator um.someone who runs an entrepreneur.accelerator is just there was this.sudden boom in people launching.businesses uh setting up Shopify.accounts setting up YouTube uh.businesses so the money really has moved.from the traditional economy the 2019.High Street economy over to the digital.economy and what we see is that the.investors know what's going on and they.just invest in This Magnificent Seven.company I think 50% of the gains of the.S&P 500 is tech companies um so all the.money just goes flooding into the the.technology companies my my belief is.that technolog is really dividing people.that essentially if you take anyone from.any background if they work in.technology uh if they're in Media Tech.Finance any of that stuff that operates.online they tend to actually do pretty.pretty well after the pandemic I ask you.a question yeah go for do you think the.average Brit American Australian whoever.the person out there is watching if they.quit their job and go work in Tech do.you think they'll be able to get.Financial Security relatively.easily depends when you defi Define.Financial Security the issue with house.prices the ability to raise a family.have a home yeah so having a home is a.big issue right so here's here's what I.here's what I see with houses cuz houses.annoy me as well my dad bought a house.for.$188,000 which is about £10,000 or less.than £10,000 and it's probably worth.over a million dollars um uh today so.something went wrong and and this by the.way is not UK specific uh the socialist.countries had house prices go through.the roof if you go to Norway or Sweden.their house prices grew by 600% uh in.then it's happening everywhere it's not.specific to anywhere it's happening.everywhere but but what happened what.what has definitely in the UK is we.actually have um a housing traffic jam.so in this country in the UK we have 9.5.million homes that have two or more.spare bedrooms big family homes have two.or more spare bedrooms and when you look.into who owns those houses 78% of.housing wealth is Baby Boomers um and.now anecdotally I take my kids.trick-or-treating at uh Halloween and we.go down a street that is big family.homes and you go knock on the doors and.it's all people over 65 right and living.in a big family home with empty spare.bedrooms we you think the average.American over 65 is living luxuriously.the average American over 65 so more.than half of the US economy is in the.hands of baby boomers right so they own.all the houses the the houses got bought.up cheap baby boomers still own those.houses to this day the big family homes.with multiple spare bedrooms are empty.um and now that creates this traffic jam.people my age my grandparents yeah they.all owned property.all four of.them died with.nothing um because that wealth which.they had in in property was was used in.equity release schemes they they it was.used in paying through their retirement.it was used in End of Life Care um do.you think when those old people die.young people today will be rich there is.half the economy held by baby burus it's.either going to be passed down or passed.into the age care industry or passed.into the but the issue of why we can't.get homes two things government.massively inflated the value of homes.through debt so they just in injected.like low interest rates that you.involved in who who is the debt to well.the debt is to anyone who can take out.Al loan because if a 0% interest rates.or 2% interest R you think it's the debt.is the ordinary families do you think.ordinary families are the creditors when.you say ordinary families you mean.bottom third so if your average British.or American family now has half a.million pounds of debt crit it's anyone.who could get their at that particular.time anyone who could get their hands on.a loan to buy a house but who has the.credit who has who is on the other side.of the debt so if the average British.family million P banking license does.the average British family have half.million pound of credit well a lot of.people have got a lot of equity in their.home now you think the average British.family is sitting on half a million.pound cash I'd love to look at the what.the actual number is but it's a couple.hundred thousand worth of equity 78 what.about the credit on the line credit on.the line owns the credit on the line in.mind it's disproportionately older.people so.think the average British old person is.sitting on million millions of pounds of.cash not millions of cash no equity well.someone is on the other side of just one.say the difference the difference is if.you inflate the value of a house you.don't have cash you have a house that's.worth a lot of money so 78% of home.ownership wealth is in the hands of.people over 65 now it's baby boomer.generation and they got a great gift.from the government which is the.government said we're going to just give.free loans away if someone previously.could have only afforded to take out a.200 Grand loan with low interest rates.they can afford a 300 Grand L do you.think it's okay that the average British.or American young person will never own.any wealth the issue is not whether it's.okay or not the issue is what do you do.about it I do you own wealth I've got.wealth yeah you own wealth but depends.what you call Wealth I do so do we three.multimillionaires do we think it's okay.that the average Brit or American young.person will never own any wealth that to.me that's because I don't think that's.okay to me that's not the debate is it.okay it's not well it it's not okay no.we want widespread would you rather that.the people who currently are.multi-millionaires would you rather that.all of the world was owned by their kids.I think that the way you see the world.as a Trader is that the world is a zero.sum game and that there's basically the.pi is a fixed pi and it gets sliced up.how fast is the growing now there's.something like this what's UK GDP growth.at the moment yeah it's not it's not.high right 1% how much did your wealth.grow in the last year uh exponentially.okay so if our weals my wealth probably.grew about 20% in the last year maybe 30.okay okay if our worlds are growing 30%.and the economy is growing at 1% where.is it coming from if it's not coming.from our viewers so I'll tell you where.my wealth comes from my wealth comes.from building technology companies and.the way it works is pretty weird which.is that I invent something out of my.head and I go to investors and I say to.the investors here's what we're going to.create and I give them a spreadsheet and.then they say we'll give you a couple.hundred grand to get started which is.called seed Capital but on paper makes.me worth a couple of million right but.there there's nothing has been taken.from anyone at this point uh the.investors have said okay we'll invest.some money then as the business succeeds.some more investors come along and they.say we'll give you a little bit more.money to keep growing it um and I'm.innovating something new and let's say.investors come in and give me a million.pounds and for 10% of the company and.the rest of the company's worth 9.million or $9 million right so I'm not.stealing something from the existing.economy I'm bringing something from.outside of the economy into the economy.um and my quote unquote net worth is.growing exponentially because investors.say we'll give you a little bit of money.that values the rest of the pie at a lot.of money but there's everyone's getting.richer in the in the wealth create.there's where there's wealth extraction.which is what Traders do they extract.from the existing economy um and they.bet on uh the economy and then there's.wealth creation which what entrepreneurs.do they come up with new ideas better.ways of doing things and they build.wealth so do you think the reason our.viewers the average Brit American are.getting poorer is because they don't.know how to create wealth no the reason.people are getting poorer is because.economic freedoms are being eroded when.we have high economic that with taxes.well anything that imp it could be.anything that impacts economic freedom.so uh taxes and regulations are big was.economic freedom higher in the 50s uh.50s was okay so 50s was a interesting.time we we were in food Russians in this.country till uh 1956 so we had 10 years.of food rations after the war um we had.a labor shortage uh because only really.men worked women hadn't entered the.workforce in Mass um there had been.three or 400,000 men killed in war so we.actually had this big labor shortage the.whole country needed to rebuild because.of the blitz had bombed it so we had.this huge need for economic activity and.not enough people to do it we only had.2% unemployment people who had had their.blown off were put to work at that.particular time so we had this boom this.postwar boom and we also had the postwar.baby boom which drove consumption uh and.then when we got to the 60s we had the.Roaring 60s or the um The Swinging 60s.right pretty amazing time in Britain and.Along Comes high taxes uh and they put.up the taxes massively at the end of the.60s um and it pretty much crashed the.economy one of the things that happened.so what were the tax rates in the 50s.well they went up as high as 80 to 90%.uh for the top for the top ear I think.it was in the 60s you sure about that I.think the 50s are unique what is the.answer feel like you they went up off.the wall they went up after the war well.in the US actually tax rates started got.before the war but also the size of.government as a percentage of GDP was.like 30% it was a tiny like we're we're.now 45% of the UK economy is government.spending we have got a mass who funds.that spending debt they the bank of.England allows them to print endless.amounts of debt which deflates Gary I.want to get your opinion here cuz you're.asking a lot of questions but I actually.don't know your opinion I just want to.know what Daniel thinks and I want our.viewers to be able to research Daniel's.opinions but how how do you disagree.with those opinions listen Daniel's a.businessman he's obviously a very.successful businessman you know I I've.not been any I'm not a businessman I'm.not going to pretend to be a businessman.I'm an economist I make money by being.right on the economy Daniel's a good.businessman and I'm right on the economy.you know it's a simple as that basically.you know I'm not a good businessman but.I've got 15 years of being right on this.on the economy and look and I know.you're probably a wealthy man you.probably don't want to pay high taxes.you probably don't want your kids to pay.high taxes but we exist in an economy.where wealth is being extracted out of.the middle class out of the working.class very very rapidly it's benefiting.people like the three of us at this.table it will benefit our kids you know.our kids will be rich their kids will be.poor and I just think we should be.honest with them capitalism's finished.we won well done Stephen well done.Daniel well done Gary it's over now our.kids will be rich their kids will be.poor they'll pay the tax taxes we won't.pay the taxes we'll avoid it I'll make.money betting on it year after year why.are we lying to them why are we lying to.them yeah I I think that's an overly.simplified view of things I don't an.overly simplified view of things that.has made me a multimillionaire yeah well.look entrepreneurs take bets on the.economy as well we take bets differently.um when we start a company we're betting.on how the econ the average British and.American worker at the 50th percentile.do you think their kids will be richer.than they are it depends if we have.economic freedom or not right we're.going to have a split test on this right.we're going to have a split test we're.going to have the UK seems like we're.going to have more taxes more.regulations and it seems like the us is.going to have less taxes and less.regulations here's what I've noticed.I've noticed that places like Singapore.that have small governments um have got.widespread affluence there's not a lot.of poverty in Singapore yeah except for.the cleaners living in the closets yeah.you know uh look but we don't count them.in the statistics just like we don't.count our viewers that that's not.widespread in well there's a lot of.people W I've seen them in the closets.I've seen them in the closets there are.there are some but they're not.singaporeans well also you only count.the rich ones look the the also the.issue is is that they've come from even.worse conditions in many cases people.mve to Singapore for an increase in.lifestyle right the um you could take.Ireland or Switzerland right.economically free places Ireland was.economically in a disaster in think the.average Irish person lives well well the.their.economy their economy almost collapsed.in 2011 and they went down the road of.lower taxes lower regulations and they.attracted all sorts of businesses into.the economy and do you think that works.well for the average Irishman who.doesn't own a home in Dublin the the if.you measure everything by Home Ownership.I'm measuring people by the average I.want to know what the average man or.woman today lives that by the way I I'm.also Furious about the home ownership.thing everyone is um I think it's.utterly ridiculous the way like the idea.that homes are now worth 10 times the.average wage all of that difference is I.blame government for that uh I blame.high taxes where they've because of high.taxes they can take out more debt they.can then inflate the economy do you.think if we shrink the government if we.start to slash government spending do.you think that would improve living.conditions well the UK government is 45%.of the economy like that's a huge.government it's think using additions.will increase in the next few years.because we have US Government now that's.planning to slash the US government well.that's what the US voters have asked for.do you think it would improve living.conditions uh do I think it'll improve.the average American if they're smaller.government yeah I trust market so you.think the average US American will be.rich in years than the here what I trust.I trust economic freedom if people have.freedom they create better decisions for.their own life there's two ways to make.decisions right there's two ways you.have freedom I got less freedom than I.did when I ared just because my sister.can't pay the rent is that freedom the.if you're living in a country she can't.to live in the city that she was born in.I I agree you and I agree on the problem.you keep bringing back to the problem I.keep bringing it back to people because.the people who watch We're millionaires.okay the people who watch us are mostly.not.millionaires is life going to get better.for them they life will get better if.you are connected to the most productive.parts of the economy um if you pretend.that it's 1955 and you recreate the.postwar era conditions if you try to go.back to 1955 I don't think that's going.to work so so let me ask on that then.the point about if you're connected to.the most productive parts of the economy.I was quite um quite surprised when I.was doing some research on this to find.that there's quite big differences.between the UK and the US in terms of.GDP growth in Q4 2024 the US economy.grew by 6% while the UK growth was 0.1%.so they're doing significantly better in.that regard US GDP per head stands at.$82,000 per head whereas the UK stands.at $49,000 per head and stock market.performance which is an indication of I.guess what ever Rose by 300% in the US.whereas the footsy 100 declined by 20%.Which is the UK stock market.productivity growth since 2018.productivity increased by 30% in the.United States which has outpaced the the.UK and lastly income growth since 2007.American income per head has increased.by 72% while it has decreased in by 2%.in the UK in dollar terms so they seem.to be doing better from if you just look.at the economy um why is that is that.because they lean more into technology.and Innovation and Entrepreneurship and.is it because of the things you were.saying earlier about their attitude.towards the Govern like reduced.government spending versus tax the rich.why I'm Keen to hear Gary's view on this.because I understand yours because.you've just said it yeah I think these.are great statistics um and of course.the US has a strong reput reputation for.being very free markets and being very.small states in the last 5 years 10.years 15 years.we've had a UK government that has been.aggressively slashing the state and the.US State's bigger than ever it's 45% of.the economy and the us we had a.government in the last four years which.has been running a massive massive.deficit so in that period of.time it appears the government which has.been aggressively increasing its deficit.has massively overperformed the.government which has been aggressively.slashing the.state that's what it looks to be from.the last I mean b Joe Biden in.enormously increased the deficit.enormously and the conservatives were.austerity government for 14 years which.one seems to have given the better.numbers well I mean there were austerity.in name only they went from 30% uh the.state was 30% of GDP to 45% of.government services haveed now they're.the government is terrible at doing most.things that's the problem you you you.don't want you don't think that spending.on government service has been slashed.let me let me zoom out a little you.think the police spending has been.slashed OH police spending is definitely.do you know where it ends up it ends up.with like big corporates uh big.Consulting who get paid $50 million to.produce a report to tell government some.thing right all of these big I won't.name names but all the big consulting.firms they're all blood suckers to.government they they know that the money.is in the government and they set up.business models to extract that money.from government uh and it also is in the.financial trading side of things the one.of the issues that we've got right and.this is a big big issue as well cuz you.care about wealth inequality one of the.biggest issues I see is that during the.pandemic we all learned to work remotely.and remotor became the norm and what I.see at the moment is huge amounts of.what would have been normal British jobs.are going to the Philippines going to.India going to uh Vietnam people who.work remotely now we now have a thousand.millionaires a month leaving to go to.Dubai we have 120,000 British people.living in Dubai uh in in that economy.the world's become incredibly mobile and.one of the things that's happening is.that what would have previously been.good British jobs uh are getting moved.overseas to lower cost countries and.that's technology that drives that wedge.the US is very smart in that they've.built a technology Powerhouse and the UK.has completely lost our technology.industry our tech industry is in Decline.same same across Europe China and the us.know that the game is Tech and they've.basically pulling all the tech company.into the into their uh borders and.what's happening a lot is the erosion of.good jobs and the erosion of of just.normal well-paying uh jobs because they.they're going and it's a bit of a.self-fulfilling Loop that the more we.lose millionaires the tax burden falls.on everyone else so they put the taxes.up and then the millionaires say oh the.taxes are too high so they leave um I've.watched some of the most incredible.entrepreneurs that you would want here.that would employ your sister at a high.rate um and they've picked up and left.cuz the taxes are too high so you saying.we should tax working people less well.the the the overall government has to be.smaller uh you can't whoever what do you.want to cut in the government if you uh.yeah I mean you'd have to Child Services.we'd have to no police no education NHS.all I know is this pensions you go to.Switzerland they SP single mothers 25%.disabled benefits what do you want to.cut hold up all I know is in Switzerland.I tell you what I want the government is.TA on those entrepreneurs and raise the.taxes on the billionaires because I.worked my tits off how many billionaires.are in the UK there's a lot of.billionaires in the UK 150 yeah so tax.them more what do they pay listen I went.my tits off and I paid it was 50% top.rate tax 50% top rate tax plus National.Insurance 60% million to bring my family.out of poverty at the same time the Duke.of Westminster inherited 10 billion and.paid nothing do you think that's fair.that's not true okay why is it not true.because the Duke of Westminster is one.of the highest tax payers in the country.what does he pay well on the trust the.groer estate uh they don't pay.inheritance tax because trusts can't die.they pay something called periodic taxes.which how much 6% every 10 years 6% so.they pay 0.6% so I paid 16% and this guy.pays 0.6% apples with apples inheritance.tax is 40% across the course of your.life if a trust is uh if a person lives.who owns a trust for 70 years then 6%.time 7 would be 42 so they actually pay.more so he pays 0.6% a year Pro 0.6%.that would be the same as what percent.did I pay per no no no but that's 60% so.you're saying I pay what 60 of a 0.6.what 100 times the tax not comparing.apples with apples wait why is it not.apples with apples this guy pays 0.6% a.year I paid 60% a year that's.inheritance tax I paid that 60% every.year Daniel every year I paid you're pay.income tax so why have I du P more than.the Duke of Westminster pays income tax.he probably he probably makes your bill.blush yeah think can pay his income tax.yeah well if he's going to live he has.to withdraw money to have his income he.also let me give you a list of all the.taxes he would pay he'd pay income tax.corporate tax he'd pay stamp Duty when.he buys a building he pays uh uh any of.the other taxes vat when he spends money.all the same taxes apply to a duuk as.they apply to anybody else so you think.he pays income tax on on the income on.that any income he draws okay well our.viewers can research whether he pays.income tax on his income because I don't.think he does.it's in a trust but the only difference.with the trust versus income is that the.trust pays periodic tax versus.inheritance tax 0.6% but we're only.talking inherit that that's just one.type of tax you think he's paying 60% on.his income he's one of the highest.taxpayers in the UK I'm not like his big.fan club but the truth is he's one of.the highest taxpayers in the UK um he's.one of the biggest Employers in the UK.he's one of the like one of the biggest.land owners in the UK land owners in the.UK right uh so uh the the issue is is.does he pay tax all the same taxes that.apply to you apply to him uh and if you.want to set up a trust you can also pay.periodic taxes as well um which would be.on top of all the other taxes so what.would you say but it's just not true.that he doesn't pay tax no what would.you say this guy has inherit 1010.million P so he's worth 10 billion PS.what would you say will be the total.amount of tax he will pay in his.lifetime well I know that just the.smallest if I make 10 million I pay 60%.just one sec you're not you're talking.about income versus the transfer of an.estate so why why is it that the be 10.million P just you're comparing your.income yeah versus the amount he.inherited which is not a fair thing.that's not income that's his income he.inheritance is not income so wait wait.wait wait wait wa so if I get given1.billion I don't pay any tax but if I.work for10 billion I pay 60% well if you.inherit this is the tax system that you.want you'll end up in a system where the.kids of the richual own everything.that's what I'm saying that's what I'm.saying and that's fun because that's our.kids you're not telling the truth about.his let's support it let's have a tax.system where your kids and my kids and.Steven's kids are multimillionaires and.these guys out there can't afford to.feed their kids and put the heat in.that's not what I'm saying but that's.what you will get that is what you will.get that's listen that's what I'm.betting on that's fine because I'll make.money in the markets it's fine and.you'll make money and you'll make money.it's our viewers who will be poor and.that's fine that's fine that's fine for.us let's let's explore the other.alternative right so let's say tax the.rich right so let's play the game of tax.the rich tax the owners not the workers.the owners.so the issue that we have with the rich.is that is the number one most valuable.Assets in the economy now in tangible.assets so there's this chart called the.S&P 500 of the 500 richest countries in.the country uh in the world in the US.sorry um in.1970s 75% of the value of the S&P 500.was physical assets like property um and.today it's less than 10% uh it's closer.to 5% you think that housing is not.particularly important just just let's.stick stick with what I'm saying okay.the the the PowerHouse the engine room.of the economy is digital assets and.that's reflected in uh the S&P 500 for.example which is 95% intangible assets.one of the issues that we have is that.the richest people are completely mobile.now so they can be absolutely anywhere.in the world so if you come up with this.idea of let's tax richest people 1% if a.tiny proportion of them leave we're all.in trouble so this really rich guys.M what do they own companies and why are.those companies worth money because.investors say they are and where do the.revenues come from globally okay the.issue is is that these companies operate.globally now so take my company for.example my company has 8,000 customers.in 150 countries okay we could be.anywhere if you P what country is your.biggest single Revenue Source probably.the US now let's say you move to Cayman.Island and the US says we're going to.tax your Revenue at point of sale M what.can you do well that's different right.because that's not taxing billionaires.that's taxing.companies see when you say tax the rich.on their wealth yeah that's different to.saying tax companies a consumption tax.oh but you just said the're Rich owned.companies you said that's what they own.yeah but you're saying how do you tax.them right so do they do you tax their.wealth which is what they own or do you.tax the companies where they trade um.typically consumption taxes get passed.on to Consumers it's not consumption tax.it's the tax on the ownership yeah but.if you simply say when you're doing.revenues then that's a consumption we.start to tax if we start to taxit by the.way I'm not exactly against you on on.companies I think it's disgusting that a.British company can can take out a.Facebook ad to sell to a British.consumer a British product and Facebook.pretends to be in Ireland on that.transaction um and Amazon you can buy.something on Amazon in Britain from a.British supplier from a British.warehouse and Amazon pretends to be in.Luxembourg in that situation and that.sucks right like that that does not seem.fair and it strikes me as very strange.that the government is okay with that.right now the government is chasing down.moms and dads who sell a few things on.eBay uh and chasing them for taxes but.they don't talk to eBay uh they they.they're paranoid about someone doing a.little bit of a side hustle on Facebook.but Facebook's fine to pretend to be an.Ireland so I don't agree with all of all.of that right like I think where missing.some serious tricks here but the idea.with taxing billionaires at wealth.billionaires will just leave they just.get up and leave and and not just.billionaires but what the billionaires.own what the billionaires own companies.and where do companies get their money.from revenues and where do the revenues.come from purchasing people purchasing.where do those people live all over the.world we can tax them at that point.that's consumption tax this is the thing.that's a consumption tax no it's not.it's V is a tax on Revenue tax these.guys on profits based on where the.revenues come from so it's very easy to.move profits internationally see Steven.had a uh Starbucks cup when he buys that.Starbucks yeah it's bought from a.British company who licenses the.Starbucks logo from Luxembourg or.somewhere like that so 15% so here we.are saying oh we're going to tax their.profits they say ah I wish we were.profitable sorry unfortunately we had to.do that licensing deal with that.International I know how profit shifting.works okay so are you you think are you.telling.me compan selling to the UK the US.enormous amount of of profit in the US.and they turn around and say actually.our profit is not in the US the.difference you think the US is in is is.incapable of going and looking if that's.seeing where they really where the.profit is I'm not saying that you can't.do this I'm saying that the benefits of.doing it it's so hard to tax wealth for.example or it's so hard to tax uh.Millionaires and billionaires that that.you end up cutting off your nose despite.your face um for every like if we.Britain for example and we build a brand.which is that we're anti- wealth we.don't want you to ever have more than 10.million if you've got more than 10.million we punish you every young.entrepreneur who comes to me and says.dan do you think I should start a.company here in this country I'm going.to say well if you do uh they'll take it.as soon as you start to make it they'll.take it as soon as if you're successful.if you get investment they're going to.tax you at your wealth if you sell the.company they're going to take it off you.I'm going to basically say to that young.entrepreneur don't build your business.in brit go start it somewhere that.they're more proactive and positive.towards entrepreneurs are we seeing that.now with this they call it the.millionaire Exodus which is for people.that don't know the UK has set to lose.the greatest proportion of millionaires.in the world um this Parliament I'll put.a graph on the screen which is this one.here this one here and that little red.line here is US losing all of our.millionaires at the moment and in 2024.it's an estimated that 10,800 high net.worth individuals left the UK which is.57% increase from the previous year.which means that 1 millionaire is.departing every 45 minutes the UK.millionaire Exodus is equal to losing.530,000 average taxpayers and another.stat the top 10% of earners in the US.account for nearly half of all consumer.spending the top 1% of income taxpayers.in the UK are projected to contribute.about 30% of total income tax from 2024.to.2025 why are all these millionaires.running away well it's not because.they're taxing their world because we.don't have any wealth taxes why why do.you think they're leaving I think the.reason they're leaving is because the UK.economy is is really really weak because.the UK consumer is really really weak.because you've absolutely crushed the.spending power of your average British.family your average British family can.barely afford to feed the kids and turn.the heating on so why are you going to.start a business here when the customers.are absolutely impoverished look it.corresponds with a new tax that we.brought in which was um we ended the.non-dom scheme so the non-dom scheme.basically said if you're living in the.UK but you've got businesses all over.the world uh then we only tax you on.what you've got in the UK um and if you.die in the UK uh we'll only tax you on.your UK assets for inheritance tax if.you're a non-dom uh but if you die in.the UK and you've got uh wealth in India.once that nonon scheme ended they.basically said we will tax you on.everything globally if you're an.economic uh if you're a tax resident in.the UK everything you've got globally we.want 40% of it so unfortunately every.wealth manager contacted their clients.and said you can't stay here you're.going to have to get out um it's it's.gotten really bad a th000 people a month.are leaving and in the UK 1% of people.pay 30% of the taxes 10% of people pay.60% of the taxes and you imagine if.we're sitting out at dinner and there's.10 of us out to dinner and one person.says hey I've got this I get I'll get.60% of the bill tonight we say to them.no it should be 70% should be 80% and.they say you know what I'll get up and.leave so they leave everyone else's bill.just doubled so what's going to happen.is if we drive the millionaires out of.this country everyone every ordinary.normal person who pays 10 grand a year.in tax will now have to pay 20 grand a.year in tax so the reason they left.because we used to allow them to not pay.tax and we Ta on their Global incomes on.their Global isn't it a bit more like if.we were 10 of us at dinner and there was.one guy who came on to dinner on the.condition he wouldn't pay their leaves.because these guys weren't paying tax.anyway the reason they left is because.they weren't paying tax it's like saying.um it's like saying hey I'll pay 60% of.this table and they say at the table hey.wait a second we also want you to pay.for everything that's happening at other.restaurants as well isn't it a bit more.like these guys we're stretching on a.condition you you yourself said the.reason why they left is because we let.them live here on the condition that.they didn't have to pay taxes on their.Global yeah taxes matter right so why.why is everyone going to Dubai Dubai.they're going there because there's no.tax these guys they live in Dubai their.money comes from the West they are.making money from the West while your.average Western ordinary person watching.this show now cannot afford to buy a.house cannot afford to have a family we.can tax those revenues at the point of.sale why do we allow these it's a called.a consumption tax no it's not it's a tax.on tax on profit not tax on consumption.you just said at point of sale which.means it's a consumption tax based on.the profits you look at how much profit.they where the profits exactly it's not.consumption tax what I'm saying so no so.if you tax profits yeah right then those.profits have to accumulate in that.country and because of the digital.ecosystem that we now have the world we.now live in I can lease the database off.of my company in Luxembourg I can uh.license the I can license my logo from.understand how profit.shifting listen these guys are not.gandal you just say we don't accept.profit shifting we don't need to accept.profit shifting China does not accept.profit shifting we did not accept profit.shifting 50 years ago we do not have to.accept profit shifting but you have a.government class who are extremely.wealthy and a media class are extremely.wealthy saying it's impossible to tax.rich people and I would like to say I.will agree 100% it is difficult to tax.rich people it is very very very.difficult to tax rich people I don't I.don't come here saying I want to tax.rich people because it's easy I know.it's hard I know probably I'm going to.lose I know our viewers kids will live.in Desperate poverty I know that I do.this because it is hard if we are a.country which says to ourselves we don't.try and do things which are necessary to.keep our kids out of poverty because.they are hard then our kids will live in.poverty I don't need to be here I'm a.multimillionaire just like you I could.be in the Philippines drinking panac.laders I come in here because I come.from a poor background and it's ordinary.families like my family like the kids I.grew up with whose kids are going to be.in poverty it's difficult but it is.necessary sometimes we have to do things.not because they're easy but because.they are hard that is what makes a rich.country rich and that is what protects.ordinary people listen our grandparents.lived in poverty did they say let's not.change it because it's hard no they.didn't they fought and they demanded.they demanded Health Care education.housing food and they got it they got it.that's why my parents could live a good.quality life they got those things they.got those things and they were aware.that in order to do that you could not.allow the super rich who have been.living lives of luxury for hundreds and.hundreds of years to eat everything.while ordinary families couldn't afford.to feed their kids I know it's difficult.I know it's difficult and I know I'm.probably going to lose I know that I.know I'm probably going to lose and that.means our viewers will be poor but I do.it anyway because I do not want this.country that I grew up in to fall into.desperate poverty I agree with you on.the passion and I agree with you on the.problem I don't agree with you on the.solution because in 2019 we be kids in.2020 and that's not what I'm saying in.2020 we made a decision globally to shut.down the economy and we taught everyone.that they can live and work from.anywhere the biggest threat to.everything you're saying is remote.working the fact that we can live and.work work from anywhere our grandparents.their boss if their boss owned a company.that company had to physically be in the.country and the boss had to physically.be in the country if we look at today.there are plenty of fitness trainers who.work for a gym and the owner of that gym.is somewhere overseas plenty of people.work in live work in a restaurant and.the owner of the restaurant lives.overseas you can live in you can run a.business from anywhere in the world.right now so the problem that we face is.that you're describing on one hand you.say we need to tax it at the point of.sale which is a consumption tax and not.tax on profit okay and then you say a.tax on profit and then you say oh but.then we'll stop profit shifting by the.way I'm also actually all for this idea.of stopping profit I I've already said I.think it's utterly ridiculous the way.that many of these global companies are.treated and if we don't stop that then.all the money just flows out to the tech.companies um so I'm I'm with you on that.but when you say tax the rich the actual.people who own the companies those.people can be anywhere right now so but.but their revenues can't their customers.their customers are where their.customers are their customers are where.their customers are listen Amazon.doesn't pay any UK tax doesn't pay any.us tax where are the customers in the UK.and Us in UK US do you really think it's.impossible for us to tax that well.you're talking about taxing people at 10.million plus right so this is a lot of.startup entrepreneurs Jeff Bez is a lot.more than 10 million jez Jeff worth a.lot more than you talk about anyone.above 10 million is on your radar you.don't want people worth 11 million.pounds we pay more I'm not just talk.it's not that Dan if you you you're.worth more than 10 million pounds so if.we tax people.on as Gary says that have more than 10.million what are your options to avoid.say if your objective was to avoid that.what options do you have look if if my.objective was to avoid it I pass a board.resolution that we're moving the head.office somewhere else yeah um we move.the intellectual property somewhere else.I pick up and move my family somewhere.else and within about a week or two.we've got a we work office somewhere.else I've got a new house on Airbnb.somewhere else and I cut ties with the.UK and I'm non- tax resident here and I.can I have a digital business I can.literally make my head office anywhere.in the world if there was a particular.country that turned hostile towards uh.our operations they not have to withdraw.service from that thing you know so that.that's possible but it's unlikely that.that would actually happen but.ultimately if I choose to get up and.leave then I get up and leave now the.the the bigger issue is would I have.even come here in the first place and.then there's another issue and here's.the other issue Gary for you you've just.had 750,000 subscribers to your YouTube.channel 820 it's 8:20 right so it's.going up fast I could have one of my.analysts at a consulting company do.valuation of your brand and do valuation.of your YouTube channel we could say.this is a fast growth media company and.it's worth 11 million right so we could.come up with a forecast and a projection.and we say Gary's economics is actually.a new Fast growth media brand it's worth.11 million now your channel now you have.to pay 100 Grand a year in extra taxes.because you're a millionaire sorry 1% on.wealth above 10 million on 11 million is.going to be 10 grand taxes oh you're.saying only on the part above that's how.taxes work so it's not on everything.it's okay so it's a it's a marginal tax.that's how taxes work it's so okay so.but is it fair that like who gets to.decide what wealth Is wealth and what.it's worth because wealth let's just hit.me out wealth is a a technical term for.unrealized gains right it's not real uh.you know someone buys a house for 20.grand and it's worth 200 Grand uh.they've still got the same house but now.they've got wealth um if someone starts.a business and a tiny little seed.investor puts in a little angel.investment uh now they've got wealth on.paper but who gets to say what is wealth.um like for.example if you introduce wealth taxes.theoretically that will actually reduce.the value of wealth of things anyway.because things in inside that economy.are now subject to a disadvantage so.therefore investors will be unlikely to.invest in them to a certain point and.also people start cutting and dodging.and weaving and ducking and weaving so.they say oh our UK operations worth 10.million so we're now going to start a.second company over in some other.country and make sure that that's where.the wealth accumulates so it's.incredibly difficult because it is just.unrealized gains I know I know it's.difficult yeah I know I know these guys.have the best accountants I I know it's.difficult I know so what if there was an.easier solution if there was an easier.solution I would support that you know.what I mean it's called it's called.economic freedom the economic freedom.index okay well just tell the viewers.that give them more economic freedom and.then they'll be rich yeah so this this.diagram here basically says the most.free countries have less than 10%.poverty in fact less than 7% poverty as.soon as you reduce economic freedom it.jumps to 30% poverty you reduce economic.freedom again and it jumps up to huge.huge amounts of poverty so the these.countries here are the least.economically free and these countries.are the most economically free the.countries that get in the way of your.economic freedom have more poverty and.the countries that let people make.decisions for their own life what you're.saying is if the governments of our.countries cut taxes on us the three.multimillionaire sitting at this table.that will improve the lives of the.ordinary British and American give a.real life example to feed their kids.I'll give you a real life example uh I.know of a company that was going to give.pay Rises to its employees and then.National Insurance went up and instead.of National Insurance is a tax on.employment yeah I'm saying to reduce.that I'm saying to reduce tax on I want.your viewers the viewers here to be.paying less tax while multimillionaires.pay more tax good in theory but of if.you could tax rich people 1% of their.wealth above 10 million uh I did a back.of a napkin cap calculation you might be.able to get 20 billion yeah right that's.if they don't leave that's if they don't.respond to it if they just happily pay.it you get 20 billion that's less than a.week worth of current government.spending.so the government's out of control 1.2.trillion a year of government spending.is now what they spend okay so let's cut.that get that 20 billion and cut the.taxes for the viewers cut their income.tax so that works out about 250 a year.okay so let's do more let's make it 60.billion so then you tax 3% above wealth.yeah do that right and then you also.bring it down this is what governments.do make five or six yeah and then and.that's what they did that's what they.did in the second world war and that's.why my dad could afford a house actually.that's not why you could afford a house.okay well who's buy if Ordinary People.are losing their houses and the wealth.which they are yeah and we're getting.richer yeah who is it who is now owning.the houses if it is not us the.government used to own the houses and.then they sold the government wealth is.collapsing government wealth is.collapsing but what they did is they.sold the houses to the people okay but.but ordinary middle is also you can only.do that once and they did it for the.baby so you think it's our viewers who.have got my houses now who where is the.wealth going Daniel where is the wealth.going who has the wealth now who is.getting rich who is getting the wealth.that is lost by our viewers I'll tell.you where the biggest amounts of money.are going the biggest amounts of money.uh since the pandemic uh 11 trillion.went just to the value of seven.companies that own te technology so the.biggest seven companies in the USA 11.trillion has and you don't want their.billionaire owners to pay more tax well.would that help the UK well if you use.that money to reduce tax on working.people then it it would help yeah they.own shares in the USA they're US.citizens so that doesn't help us here.but it will help the American Consumer.and then we can export the American.Consumer and it will mean the American.Consumer has money and then it will show.British people how much you can achieve.by taxing Super Rich we can raise tax on.our Super Rich here and then what I want.is these guys to be taxed so much that.they start to sell assets and then.ordinary British people can buy assets.again because what I want is our viewers.to be able to own things to be able to.own their own homes I when I hear this.um I admissibly don't know as much about.these issues as you guys do but when I.hear that there's these seven tech.companies in the US my brain goes can't.we have one here yeah yeah can't we.start and then so my brain goes how what.conditions do we have to create ones.that we had yeah what conditions do we.have to create to have one of those.seven tech companies here especially in.this sort of AI World we're heading.towards where when I was reading through.the stats most of the investment in AI.which is going to be hugely.destabilizing across every industry from.driving to to any form of knowledge work.even podcasting I can play your podcast.now yeah which sounds exactly like me.which has a 4.6 star rating on Apple.which was written by AI in my voice.published by AI Wild and the and who's.acing the value there well it's a.company in America called 11 labs and.it's bloody open Ai and I why why can't.we have those companies here we need.them here because China and the US are.dominating this next.Revolution um and I I worry as a.bystander that if we don't create.entrepreneurship friendly environments.here we're going to we are going to.become Indian yeah M so you if you want.businesses that to thrive you don't need.just a good environment for.entrepreneurs you also need people to.have money that they can spend MH and we.are in a country where.increasingly most of the people out.there have almost nothing left over at.the end of the month they can barely pay.the bills those companies are selling.globally right so they don't need any.particular company to do well they just.they sell to anywhere so like open AI.chat GPT we're all using that Bloody.product and pay our 20 $30 a month yeah.where do they actually get their money.from right they get their money from.selling data to to to the rich right my.point was making the environment more.friendly for entrepreneurs because when.I start a company I am at a I can't.explain the disadvantage I'm at at the.moment if I start that kind of company.here in the UK there's no investors and.then all the talent seems to flock over.to San Francisco so the the guys that.built the British guys that built an AI.company called fixer which I was going.to invest in all British Lads from.London they went over to San Francisco.they're like 25y olds they've just.raised at a 60 million valuation they're.in this room this building in San.Francisco full of entrepreneurs and.they're pumping knowledge and capital.into this room with all due respect.Stephen you're not a great example for.the fact that it's impossible to start a.successful online brand in the UK facts.um but I also realized that the problem.of of but he started when things were.different but I I also realized I don't.like using personal examples because.there's a huge amount of privilege and.okay is there a chat gbt in Germany No.is there a chat gbt in in France no is.there a chat GPT in Australia no no is.there a chat GPT in ja it's China and.one sec SEC yeah exactly what you have.here is an extremely low labor extremely.high Capital model which employs.extremely few people across the entire.world that is focused in basically two.cities yeah good luck competing with.that H how do we create an environment.where the UK can start to build some of.these companies which are going to.capitalize on this next technological.Revolution how if you were prime.minister what would you do I think you.need to look realistically about what.companies do we have a chance of growing.you know I'm not an expert in AI but I.think trying to compete with San.Francisco in London would will probably.not work why try try and do it you know.try and do it and listen I know that you.can get a lot of likes saying let's just.invest in AI let's just invest only one.city in the world outside of China has.Managed IT China has Managed IT by.basically State capitalism you know this.is very similar in a sense to what we.had with micro Electronics in Japan in.the 8S right when you have a new.industry especially these industries.which are very Capital intense and don't.employ many people you get a first move.Advantage they tend to win eventually.often they get undercut by cheaper.Rivals and that does happen you know.that does happen and you might stand in.AI I don't think AI is going to become a.massive massive employer of course you.know a lot of countries are going to be.like because basically it sounds good.we're going to invest in I we're going.to invest in AI personally I think we.should be looking at what does the.British person need you know we live in.a country where the housing stock is.falling apart if if we say AI when we.talk about AI I think we're actually.talking about technology because even a.podcast like a podcast like this you.don't think this of this as an AI.company but actually now the editing.process the scripting process the.transcription process even YouTube.itself is an AI company so it's it's.really technology we're speaking about.here and I'm wondering why we can't.create a better environment in the UK to.start launching and building some of.these technology companies we've even.seen I think we should and I think we.should be looking we should be look at.reducing taxes on people who who work.and make money this is what I've been.saying for the whole time what about.people what about people who start.companies.yeah we should reduce their taxes on the.income that they make but then if they.start owning A50 million pound company.are you telling me if you come to me and.I say all right you want to start a.company we we tax you very very little.on a company that you start if that.company becomes worth 20 30 40 million.quid then we're going to start taxing.you you're going to come and say to me.oh no sorry 50 million is not enough for.me so can I ask a question on that so um.my company was was valued at x 50.whatever 100 Millions um congratulations.I still had because I hadn't had an exit.event yeah I still had 101,000 20,000 in.my bank account are you saying at the.point when I sell the company or are you.saying just because I have shares from.the company I think you can structure it.a number of ways you can structure a.number of ways my preferred way is to.stop people from hoarding enormous a of.wealth for enormous amounts of time.that's my that's basically my preferred.method there's also the wealth tax.method there's also capital gains as a.method there's a lot of different ways.it there's a lot of different ways but.you have to deal with the problem of if.you do not do not tax very wealthy.individuals and very wealthy families.their share of the pie will obviously.goow over time and they will and they.are as we are watching squeezing our.ordinary families you have to deal with.that my friend sold his company in the.UK it's a company everybody knows um and.he I remember him saying to me at the.time it was in the middle of the.pandemic he got this big exit event I.think he'd made 300 million and he goes.I'm off I go where you going he goes I'm.going to go to Dubai in Monaco and live.between the two and I I said explain to.me why he goes well the amount of tax.I'd have to pay in the UK is equivalent.to me paying 20 million rent in the UK.for the next six or seven years which.he'd have to stay here for so he he went.and he pops back in every now and then.but it meant that he could keep that 150.million whatever tax he would pay never.had to pay it to the UK is living this.highflying life now in Dubai drops into.Monaco every now and then um and I.remember him saying to me well Steve I'd.have to pay 20 million rent a year to.live here and he went on to say the UK.product is just isn't worth it he goes.crime I'm going to get my Rolex robbed.off me he goes um the healthare system.isn't the best the education system.isn't necessarily the best and the.particular one was crime which is I'll.get I'll get i'll get mugged walking.through yeah London streets Stephen if.you allow British people who own 300.million pound of British assets to.technically live in Monaco and not pay.tax then you will get crime and you will.have dirty streets and you will have a.bad Health Care system and you will have.education because if you give all of the.wealth to a group of people who do not.tax there will be nothing left to.provide things like healthcare and.education for ordinary people it's not.unconnected these people are not.technically living there they're moving.out my friends have moved out of the.country they don't come back to the UK.they've left and they leave with their.they built a company here they glob P.tax they typically build globally.business it's not that they P it was a.global they don't pay no tax they pay.extortionate amounts of tax right anyone.who's here is paying extraordinary taxes.more than they've ever paid before 1%.pays 30% 10% pays 60% of 1 trillion a.year gu 300 million how much tax Rec.he's paid in his life I have no idea I.have no idea his business was Global.that his biggest customer was the US.it's I pay 60% and our viewers will pay.30 40 50% do you think it's fair that.your 300 million guy pays his two or.three I have no idea what he pays well.it sounds like he didn't pay 50% well he.dashed when before he got the tax bill.but why did we allow it why did we allow.I I'm not allowed to not pay my tax what.could you have done to you are allowed.to when you were in Japan you wouldn't.have paid UK taxes.yeah because I was working in Japan and.I pay Japanese taxes because you're.living in Japan this is the thing people.can live wherever they want now so but.we're talking about this is I think we.should stop obfuscating tax on people's.work from tax on the ass they uh so I'm.talking about entrepreneurs work.generates wealth so when if I if I ear a.billion pound of British houses yeah and.then I say I live in Dubai yeah and I'm.getting the rent on a billion pounds of.houses which would probably be something.like like that's going to be something.like 50 million a year so I'm getting 60.50 60 million a year of rent from.British people yeah and that gets paid.to me from British people yeah and I pay.and I don't pay tax I live in Dubai do.you think that's fair no all right so.let's change that let's let's make.people pay tax on on their world.regardless where they live yeah the.question would be though how would you.tax people right and how would you.actually structure it because regardless.of what you feel like is fair this is.the thing it's not about fairness it's.about what you can pragmatic and.practically do in the modern economy you.might say oh I actually like for example.if we said what's fair a lot of people.would say a flat tax is fair you make.one pound you pay 20% you make a million.pounds you pay 20% make 100 million.pounds you pay 20% so a lot of people.would say the fairest tax system would.just be a flat tax on everything right.that would be a fair thing it's.pragmatically can you do it is it.actually good for society should people.be excluded from that so it's not about.fairness it's about pragmatically what.can you get away with all right well.pragmatically what we can get away with.is desperate poverty for our viewers.kids if you want to have can we zoom out.just a minute right I want to zoom out.let's Zoom away from our viewers kids.forget about them they're not I got I'm.a dad right I got three kids you're you.are a multimillionaire dad you probably.don't have the same problems as our.viewers do you know that do you know.that kids born into the top have a 60%.chance of dropping out of the top right.60% that's the number it's called.persistence you can Google it um the.persistence rates is actually only 40%.for the richest so which means 60% drop.out in the second you think kids have a.60% chance of living in poverty POS not.poverty do you know what's interesting.we're all trying to aim at the same goal.I think here I'm not sure we are but.well that's fair that's fair maybe we're.not I suspect some of us are maybe.trying to protect our kids I want.widespread affluence through the.technological Revolution that's.happening and I don't want the people.who create that to want to go somewhere.else so you agree with me that we should.cut tax on wealth creators and raise tax.on wealth.orders uh well broadly okay so let's do.it let's cut on people who are making.let cut tax on people who are working.hard creating a good product making a.good income and let's raise tax on.people who are sitting there on 20 30 40.100 200 500 million pounds of assets.that they're going to give to their kids.and they're going to use to dominate.society and squeeze out the middle class.so who's an example of someone who's.hoarding wealth she so his family owns a.tech company.his wife's dad owns a tech compan which.he will inherit and his kids will.inherit his net worth that is quoted is.based upon his wife's but that company.already exists yeah it's created now.yeah it's worth billions but they they.have to reinvent that business every two.years like it's a so you think that the.reason you think that if R's.father-in-law stopped managing the.company it would be valueless no I think.it it it hires hundreds of thousands of.people and it's you know it's a big.company I don't know a lot about that.particular company but I know it's a.tech company Steve Jobs died okay is.Apple valueless no let's not pretend.that these creators are the sole reason.these companies are are valuable sure.you know and what we're talking about in.many cases you know I was a Trader okay.and I'm worth a millions of quid and you.know now that is just assets I just own.the assets I own the assets and that.will grow and it will grow and it will.grow and it will grow and that will.squeeze out and squeeze out and squeeze.out and squeeze out our viewers and I'll.give that to my kids they don't even.need to work they wouldn't even have.even have to work they could just live.on I could live on off the wealth is.that what you want do uh do you think.there are any opportunities for people.today like if you're born into a poor.family do you think it's possible that.housing being and we can both agree.agree on that but do you think there are.new opportunities that didn't exist for.our parents or grandparents but they do.exist for people today I think the.reality is for kids from poor.backgrounds it is almost.impossible to realistically get even.Financial Security never mind wealth but.why do you think you could do it I could.do it he could do it but you don't think.other people could do it well the first.thing is I'm 38 now so I'm not not a kid.nowadays um listen I want every Mass.competition I've ever been in you know.what I mean since I was a little kid I.didn't even have a desk in my house you.know I was one of the top students at.LC and I still had to win my job by.cheating in a card game you know that's.the world that we live in I don't think.that's a very replicable strategy and.it's very easy for People Like Us who've.made money to say oh AR we did it aren't.we great go out and you know you've said.that you think if young people go and.work in Tech business they can get.Financial Security if it was that easy.they'd all be doing it you know they're.not idiots our viewers are not idiots.they're trying trying they're trying.they want to find the good opportunities.and they work listen I speak I'm the one.saying they're idiots you're the one who.says that they can't do it anymore I I.see people do it all the time like I'm.working in entrepreneurs people from.poor backgrounds and so so then so but.then why are I VI you think all of our.if it was that easy why is everybody not.doing it I'll tell you why people aren't.doing it we went through a schooling.system that taught us how to get an.office job okay right we went through a.schooling system to prepare us for a uh.a world that doesn't really exist.anymore which is the Industrial.Revolution world and you have to go.through a process of figuring out how it.really works so what what I see is the.most often the people who do really well.financially who are young they dropped.out of school they dropped out of.University they started learning how to.do things uh by doing their own research.they start their own business or.co-found a business they take a very.alternative path uh none of that was.taught to us at school none of it's.taught to us in normal society we have a.school system that manufactures people.for a set of skills that are not.particularly valuable anymore and we.also get them in debt for those skills.um when people Sid step that and say.okay I'm not going to get into.University debt I'm just going to go off.and actually figure out how the world.works there's actually loads of.opportunities okay so I guess we've.sorted it then all our viewers need to.do is go and buy Dan's book become an.entrepreneur and become a millionaire.it's that easy why W you guys doing it.to begin with they're idiots the viewers.are idiots they should be just being.more entrepreneurial it's as simple as.that more entrepreneurial start a.business listen I come from East London.okay my friends can't feed their kids.okay and if it was as simple as going.out and be an entrepreneur I can bet you.they would do it I can bet you they.would do it let us I'm sick of.multi-millionaires telling kids who.can't afford to turn the heating on you.just need to be more entrepreneurial.it's sick Dan it's sick I this gives.people mental illness it gives people.mental illness tell them the truth okay.we your older generation we took the.opportunities and now is almost.impossible to out of poverty and don't.just don't just stand up and wave you.know your millions of pounds in front of.them and say if you entrepreneurial like.me you could do it you could have it.because it's sick because they can't.they can't feed their kids down they.can't turn the heating on don't tell.them to be more entrepreneurial fix the.system that drives more and more and.more of them into poverty every.generation I find it very strange that.you think it would be easier to fix the.entire global economic system than to.start a business and fix your own.personal economics the the thing that.the thing that I know that gives people.mental health issues is feeling that.they have no agency in their life that.they can't do anything your video where.you talk about if you don't have a rich.dad you're screwed there's no such thing.as meritocracy you're never going to be.successful to me if I had have come.across your content at 19 20 years old I.would have been screwed I was so I'm so.glad that I came across people who said.Daniel you weren't born into a a rich.family you don't have any Bank of mom.and dad but it's cheap and easier than.ever to start a business start by.working for someone who's got a business.then figure out what's your opportunity.and there's a way there is a way I've.actually worked with a lot of teenagers.from poor backgrounds and one of the.things we do is we tell them if it's.possible for someone else it is possible.for you um I also worked in rural Uganda.um with a charity that did uh work with.the poorest of the poor um one of the.most incredible things I ever saw was a.woman who started.out literally picking food out of a.trash uh pile um and she was basically.sh they they shared with her how to.start a chicken business which then.ended up as a pig business which then.ended up as a cattle business and she.ended up uh making uh hiring 15 16.people in her local community the power.of Entrepreneurship is that starting.with nothing you can.actually make improvements I'm not.saying everyone ends up as a millionaire.and I'm not saying everyone ends up uh.equal but I'm saying you can make.improvements in your life and the thing.that causes mental health issues is the.feeling of having no agency or no.control over your circumstances until.the world changes the whole economic.system I never told people don't work.hard I never once said that never once.said that never said that you said if.your dad wasn't Rich you'll never be.rich which is true in 99.9% of cases.I've never told people don't work hard.true 99% I've never told people don't.work hard okay and listen if you think.that ugandans should be more.entrepreneurial I've never been to.Uganda maybe that's the problem out.there maybe that's the problem in.Nigeria maybe that's the problem in.India listen I've never said don't work.hard okay when I brought my book out.last year the hardback I was at some.event and I come out I was drinking.London Bridge and uh I come out late it.was like it was like 1:00 a.m. and um.some guy come up to me when I was.unlocking my bike some guy from.Newcastle which is the northeast of.England it's this quite a poor town.there's a lot of workingclass people.there and um he said I've been watching.you on.YouTube and um I love your stuff and um.this guy started crying this guy start.crying on the street right in front of.me he's like I work so hard Gary I work.two jobs um my mom's sick and I'm trying.to help I'm trying to support and and I.don't understand why and and I'm sorry.that I'm.crying but nobody ever told me that it.wasn't my fault before that's what he.said to me okay and listen listen I.believe 100% aspiration ambition.entrepreneurial spirit I would never say.see a kid that has that and say turn it.off okay but the flip side of your if.you just work hard enough you can make.it is if you didn't make it it's because.you didn't work hard enough and it's.your fault and I would like you to sit.and think very hard before you send that.message to young men and young women in.our.society meritocracy doesn't mean that.everyone uh ends up with the same result.what what I'm trying to what here's what.I'm trying to achieve I'm trying to.achieve the people who have ambition who.can go for it are incentivized to do it.and incentivized to build jobs and build.companies about the ones that just want.to work hard and have a good family and.take care of them and have a home and be.able to turn the heating on and be able.to Financial Security they need to work.for business don't they they need to.work for you yeah P they need to work.they need to work for a business some.business right if someone doesn't create.that business then where do they work.for we now have by the way we now have.11% of 11% of working age people are now.declared too sick to work right we have.a huge problem in the UK we also have.25% of uh people who are working age.don't work uh it's one in seven men.don't work work at all do you think.they're lazy Dan I think the system is.collapsing do you think think the system.is average British American working is.lazy what I think is happening is that.the technology companies are totally.transforming and disrupting everything.um and what happened is around the.post-war era we had good jobs we had um.you could work in a local thing what's.happening now is that jobs are going to.the Philippines they're going to uh.techn technology does three things it.makes jobs more simple which makes them.replaceable.it makes jobs Global where you can move.them to anywhere else and then.ultimately it automates the job Al.together and gets rid of it uh through.code and software and what's really.going on in the last especially 5 years.since the pandemic is technology has.decimated the existing systems uh that.we all relied upon when we grew up and.when I say the uh education system isn't.really working it's still pretending.that there are office jobs available for.people when they graduate and it's still.pretending that there's like 1950.scenarios available when actually my.kids are going to be disrupted by AI.everyone's kids are going to be.disrupted by AI um you know these sorts.of things are the are the things that.really we we also need to be talking.about to all the founders and small.business owners listening I think you.need to hear this it's an update from my.sponsor Fiverr they've just launched.something called Fiverr go and in short.it's a huge game changer for you and.your team it's a tool that's been.created to help Freelancers train and.control a personalized AI tool specific.to them and in their style which means.that fiver Freelancers and their clients.can now generate unique work almost.instantly purely by combining their own.unique style of freelance Talent with.personalized AI technology the big.unlock for me here is time and getting.more of it back what might have taken me.a few days or a week can now be done in.seconds with five ago you get what you.want and you get it straight away and if.you need tweaks the original Talent is.on hand for fine.fivo is already available across 60.categories and that number is growing.rapidly if it's something you'd like to.tap into head to fiver.com diary now and.explore fiveo use code diary for 10% off.your first order this is the moment.where AI superpower meets human talent I.I want to take this back to a point you.were talking about earlier which is.about personal agency because I would.like you Daniel to give the counter to.your own argument because I want to make.sure when we're talking about solutions.to this problem start a business be.entrepreneurial you can also understand.how that might that works for people.with our brains and our mindset and.whatever we had that made us do that our.risk appetite our trauma whatever it.might be but not everybody is wide in.such a way so that's not necessarily the.best solution for and also we sit here.with a bit of hindsight bias where we we.were lucky and it worked out for us but.when you look at the stats around.businesses succeeding what you know the.stat it's like 90% of businesses fail so.most of them are failing.the ones that emerge from that people.like me then we have a bias where we go.well it work for us you do it too I.don't come from money so I have the same.bias like I watched well I've I've built.I've built from scratch several times.because I got disrupted several times so.I've had to start with nothing several.times and build but you started type of.person right and when we say start from.nothing you actually started with a.wealth of information and the whole game.in building building Capital.intellectual Capital having been through.it before being around that Mentor that.gave you the information also having.access to a great market like having.access to a free market is is a big.thing I was born in Australia and I.moved to London at the peak of London's.economic freedom so this can't be.broadly applicable advice can it uh well.I think personal agency is broadly.applicable the idea I got this friend of.mine who woke up one day he went out.clubbing went out to a nightclub felt.sick collapsed woke up and they had.chopped off all four limbs right so uh.he had quadruple ampute um he was 19.years old so he wakes up in bed and he.basically says I'm a quadruple ampute I.was I was fine 48 hours ago and now I'm.a qu quadruple amputee and he decides to.make this decision in the in the.hospital room um that this is going to.be the best thing that ever happened to.him and he makes that decision right.even that is a consequence of his him.and his wiring what I'm trying to.understand but he ended up he ended up.starting a clinic and it's a.multi-million dollar Clinic I mean it's.incredible what can do the rule it's.incredible what people but you only need.a few people to succeed and the whole.economy starts to improve we we actually.in this UK we only at the peak of our.entrepreneurial like blitzing it where.we're doing so well there was only.40,000 scale UPS 40,000 companies were.creating jobs growth higher wages um.investment into the company into the.country you know it's only 1% of people.who pay 30% of the taxes and 10% of.people who pay 60% of the taxes so you.only need one in a 100 to actually.create something that's valuable and you.get an extra 30% of taxes but so so that.again is we need this one that advice.for the what the people that end up.getting into that 1% but who does.everyone else work for like all jobs.growth comes from entrepreneurs so what.are you saying to those the 199% there.are you saying go get a job well you you.need wealth creators in the economy who.are building something like you take um.gym shark people who work at gym shark.they're super glad that this guy started.the company they're really happy that.there's a company otherwise where would.they go what would they work where would.they work so if Ben decides that he.doesn't want to start that company in.the UK um or if he gets to 10 million.and.stops uh then all of those additional.jobs are are toast they're all gone so.you encouraging the entrepreneurial.you're not encouraging everyone to.become an entrepreneur you're saying.those that have those that bias or that.I'm saying we need a system that.encourages the people who can to do um.and what about everybody else well every.the flow on effect is that that creates.jobs that creates wealth in the economy.um and free markets lift everybody up.um free markets just means that.everyone's trading with everyone um you.know it starts to like the whole thing I.mean it's it's just a tail as oldest.time as soon as economies are free and.there are entrepreneurs starting things.and growing things everyone's life.improves everyone life get better um and.what's your what part of that do you.disagree with Gary I think it's it.doesn't work it doesn't work the only.period listen the last 70 years are not.normal Stephen the last 70 years are not.normal the last 70 years in Europe and.the US where ordinary people like my dad.could work for the post office on less.than average wage and buy a house and.support family it's not normal it's not.normal in the world and it's not normal.in history most countries in the world.do not like that most countries have a a.small Super Rich Elite and a very large.group of extremely poor people that's.most of the country and it's most of.history in this country and it's most of.history in the US you know yeah we talk.about Charles Dickens I read hard times.I read hard times and this is written in.the 19th century when Britain was like.the industrial super of the whole world.and at the time the government was.talking about should we tax these.industrialists and the industrialists.were saying if you tax us we'll throw.our factories into the sea and it just.reminds me you know the only time we've.ever really been able to provide decent.living conditions for ordinary working.people was the period after the war.where we massively redistributed wealth.and and now we're losing that that.holding of wealth in of the middle class.can you acknowledge though that that was.a completely different time as it.relates to being able to it was a.different time but you.I could you know of techy Nigeria today.Brazil today the UK 300 years ago France.200 years ago there is only one specific.time that we have ever successfully.provided broad living standards for.ordinary people and it was a period of.time we protected a broadly equal wealth.distribution and tax the rich at very.high rates and you can acknowledge that.that's extremely hard to do because the.nature of the economy 100% 100 that's.the reason why all of our grandparents.and our great-grandparents and our great.great grandparents lived in poverty and.that's why I know I'm probably going to.lose and that's why I bet on the economy.getting worse and that's why I know.poverty is going to increase because it.was extremely difficult to get the.unusually fair share for ordinary.working people and I know we're losing.the argument and I know that farage will.win and I know that Trump will win and I.know that and I know that things will.get worse I don't think I'm going to win.so if you if you know you're promoting a.a strategy that is not going to work and.it sounds like you think is.incredibly almost impossible then why.would you not be more practical in your.solution Stephen if it was impossible I.wouldn't be here think it's possible of.course it's possible of course it's.possible but you believe you're not.going to win I'm a betting man Steve I'm.a betting man I put my bets on you know.I am if I get okay look okay so my.YouTube channel is growing really really.quickly and you know I'm obviously like.starting a bit of a movement and there's.a lot of political support and if it.keeps growing we'll get more political.support at the end of the day I'm trying.to tax the richest and most powerful.people in the world and most of these.people will come out and attack me and.they'll try and stop me and I do not.have billions of pounds hundreds of.millions of pounds to use to support my.YouTube channel I'm counting on ordinary.people like your viewers to support and.share my message now listen for most of.history that has not worked and for most.of History ordinary families live in.poverty I don't think it's impossible.that we Ordinary People can win and get.a fair share but I think it's worth.fighting for Steve so I fight for it.anyway he's he's right that for most of.History you've had the super Elite and.then everyone else is down here and it's.massive wealth inequality is almost the.normal uh for the last five thousand.years and almost everywhere uh you've.got kings queens dukes and peasants and.surfs down there there have been.economic situations that have been.different uh Dubai is a really strange.situation it's a desert it's in.inhospitable to live in it's the last.place in the world most people would.think or choose that they would want to.be and yet it's one of the most.economically rich places in the world.right now they actually didn't start.with oil wealth they were able to borrow.money to build Dubai but the low tax.environment has now attracted raed some.of the world's most talented people to.go and build technology companies there.and if you I don't know have you been.there recently I've been to Dubai few.years AG now but I've been so at the.moment it is the most thriving.entrepreneurial community on Earth.outside of the US but probably even.rivaling the US that there are investors.there's entrepreneurs and the wealth is.going through the roof um I've got two.friends who are personal trainers.fitness trainers one fitness trainer has.decided to stop working uh more hours.because he's hit 50 Grand a year and he.now gets taxed at 40% so he's basically.decided he's going to earn right up to.50,000 and then stop working and then.the other fitness trainer went to Dubai.launched an online uh Fitness uh.community and has just bought a $350,000.Ferrari uh and one entrepreneur is super.pumped and super excited about building.a business because he's not over taxed.the other entrepreneur has literally.said I'm not willing to do this because.of how much I have to pay just want to.be clear I've always campaigned for.lower taxes on rich on working people.always always so but here's but here's.the thing right if I was ask you you've.just become one of the best selling.authors in the country if your publisher.came to you and said because you're in.the top 1% of our authors we're going to.Harve your royalties uh if you sign a.second book with us you wouldn't sign a.second book with them you go to another.publisher who says we'll pay you more.royalties because you're so successful I.would have written this book for free.then I would have written this book for.free in fact the first time I got off of.a deal I said I said don't pay me an.advance then give you royalties away why.well because if what I'm saying all.right fine I'll give my royalties away.I'll shut my YouTube channel down I'm.saying we respond to incentives that if.your publisher if penguin came to you.and said book number two you get half.royalties because you're in the top 1%.would you sign with penguin or would you.go someone El from a 2 million job a.year to run a YouTube channel do you.think I do the work that I do for money.I'm not talking about that you do it for.money I'm just saying if you had the.option to sign between two publishing.contracts right and all things being.equal one's going to penalize you for.being in the to 1% and the other one's.going to reward you for being in the top.1% would you you of course you would go.with the normal like if all things being.equal you want to write a second book.anyway it's the same for entrepreneurs.when entrepreneurs start companies we.can either start them in high tax.economies or with a stroke of a pen.start them in low tax I think the rich.world is going to have to start.rethinking the fact that it allows.people to very very wealthy people to.own enormous amounts of their physical.wealth go live overseas and not pay tax.I think that has to be Revisited for.sure because what you're saying is I.want the benefit of being able to sell.to the US market and the UK Market but I.don't want the obligation of having to.pay us and UK taxes and you are correct.that at the moment the US and UK.governments allow that and I think.that's US taxes you on worldwide income.well only a small amount right so I.think that realistically I think that.the US and UK governments have to stop.that but the way I see it the US and UK.governments and increasing a lot of.global governments are kind of being.bought up by the elites and you know we.have ELO musk is basically the President.right and we had richy sunak who father.was one of the richest men in the world.like if you're richy sunak who for our.American viewers was our prime minister.until very recently his father is one of.the richest men in the world he's got.700 million personal wealth he's going.to be making 3040 million pound passive.income and you're getting paid 130 Grand.de to be prime minister when you're.making policy do you think maybe I'll.ask my father-in-law at once you know.the fact is what you're seeing here is.if you allow the rich I'm I'm never ever.against entrepreneurship I'm not against.people getting rich if you allow the.rich to get richer and richer and richer.they squeeze the middle class and they.squeeze the poor class out of things.like housing of things like space in.cities of things like energy and of.things like owning a sharing government.and media do you acknowledge that.countries that adopt a anti-ri big.government approach tend to collapse.what like like this country in the.60s we needed a US bailout we needed an.IMF bailout in 1976 but the US did the.same thing the US had even higher taxes.than us we we basically like you take.you take all the countries that where.the government becomes big they meddle.with your life they're involved in every.decision right half the economy I mean.here's one other the things this period.is known as the Golden Age of capitalism.it's the period of time when which.period thisi 50 years off the second.world war oh it's the Golden Age of.middle class to be middle class you.don't care about the middle class no no.of course I do the the but the 70 years.after the World War II yeah where the.government sold off all of its houses to.middle class people so we got housing.wealth but you can only do that trick.once right so you can only sell off all.the houses to everyone once which is why.all the Baby Boomers own them well the.living s is collapsed after the houses.were sold there was a long period where.the houses weren't sold between the.second world war and the 80s pinpo.living standards collapsing well I think.there's a few obviously big moments I.think 2008 is a big moment I think Co is.a big moment I think it's the 80s where.you start to see the wealth distribution.go what matters is actually the.distribution itself so once you change.the tax system it takes a bit of time.for the wealth distribution to change.but once you start for me the big thing.is is the loss of wealth holding I want.ordinary families to be able to hold.wealth and once you lose that you lose a.middle class and you will not find me a.single country in in the world now or.the history of the world that has.provided good broad living standards.without allowing ordinary families to.own assets yeah I agree and take.Singapore for example where everyone's.encouraged to own properties they've got.an amazing system in Singapore they've.taken this a massive government by the.way enormous government 25% of GDP they.they own they own the houses they have a.weal f they own all the houses they.don't own all the houses they have a a.sovereign wealth fund that circulates.houses through they've they own the hous.they' solved they've solved Singapore.owns the house they own the Singapore.government owns an enormous share of the.houses so do you think we should own.pension Pension funds people uh they.force not force their citizens but they.uh direct their citizens into Home.Ownership you don't think Singapore and.government owns a large sh I just know.that the Singaporean government's only.25% of the economy but big sh of the.housing stock 75 the economy is I would.like to say by the way just to be really.clear I've never ever once advocated for.big government never a single time big.government I want higher taxes on the.wealth orders so we can tax wealth.creators and working people less I don't.want to Big A government I want our.viewers to have more money I want our.viewers to have more money and also I.want to tax those super rich so that.they stop squeezing ordinary families.out of asset ownership it just yeah it.see it it seems like an obvious solution.it seems like yeah it's good solution it.seems like like hey who's got the money.rich people not the money the assets the.asset who's got the assets rich people.then let's just take them off them and.no no no I don't want I don't want to.redistribute I'm I'm I am the only.person in this table anti-.redistribution because the.redistribution is happening in front of.our eyes the middle class is losing its.assets government is losing its assets.those assets are being accumulated by.the rich I want to stop the.redistribution please please I'm I am.the most anti- rist redistribution.person in this game we need to stop the.redistribu of wealth away from ordinary.British and American families so the.difference is for me it's very simple.which is I really truly believe that.free markets and low governments and.less taxes creates more wealth in the.middle and freedom for the Heron is.death for the fishes if we have complete.Freedom multi-millionaires like you and.me will get richer and richer and richer.every year and we will squeeze out and.we will eat the middle class ask you.though if wealth inequality could be.solved but everyone does worse is that a.good solu obviously not the whole reason.I do this because I don't want Ordinary.People toap into public this is about.people being able to feed their kids so.wealth inequality is not the problem.it's collapsing living stand that's.quite contorted I mean quite contorted.Logic the problem isaps living standards.I am somebody who has made millions of.pounds by understanding the simple fact.that living standards are falling.because of growing wealth INE equality.so living standards if they were to.increase but they were super rich yeah.is that a problem I think you do need to.be worried about us extremely wealthy.Elites yeah I think what's interesting.you look at the the founding of the.United States these guys the founding of.the United States conceptually is really.based on these ideas of distribution of.power that's why you have the president.and the house and the Senate and you.have this independent Judiciary they're.like we cannot allow power to become.concentrated because they came from a.Europe which had extremely concentrated.power and extremely wealthy Elites and.extremely broad poverty so I think that.allowing a small group of Society to.increasingly monopolize power and wealth.over time is obviously something we.should be worried about but primarily.the reason I worry about wealth.inequality is because I see and I bet on.and I make money on the fact that it.causes living standards to Fall by the.way I I actually really agree with you.and the founding fathers of the US they.did um especially around the 1900s they.did want to break up monopolies and.break up monopolies was one of the big.things that um they did trust busting uh.where they broke up Standard Oil and all.of those sorts of things one thing I do.really really see happening at the.moment is that we have a stupid outdated.definition of monopolies where we use.monopolies the same way they used it.when they had the oil uh companies that.owned all the oil in the technology.World a monopoly is formed through an.ecosystem so Amazon for example owning.AWS and Audible and this and this and.this and Whole Foods it creates a a.fortress that's almost impossible to um.to compete with and Google owning.YouTube and Gmail and all of this they.create these fortresses through.ecosystems one of the things that I do.think we need to look at is compulsory.breakup of big Tech once you hit a.certain time because it's very difficult.because do you know billionaires have.two big fears right keep them up at.night uh having nightmares number two is.high taxes number one is that startup.entrepreneur who disrupts their business.and they want to kill that early you.know Steve Jobs at 24 years old.disrupted IBM um and Jeff Bezos.disrupted Walmart so they are terrified.of entrepreneurs in the middle um and.they want to create government.regulations to say hey you know what.let's cap entrepreneurs at 10 million.you can get to 10 million it's okay for.us we're way past that point but Gary's.our guy because he's going to cap.everyone I never said cap anyone at 10.million by the way what do you think.will happen people stop as soon as you.have wealth taxes people just give up.they just don't want telling me our.viewers if if they said if they knew.they could build a 20 30 million SS.ridiculous they knew they would have to.pay 20 if you if you're if you're worth.30 million 1% above is 200 Grand a year.so if I said if you you can have a 30.million pound company TR just bear in.mind right you make 5% a year on your.wealth right so if you got 300 million.pound company you're going to be making.15 million pound a year and I'm turning.to you and I'm going to say you know.you've got to pay 200 Grand a year on.your 50 million pound revenue and.they're going to say you know what I'm.not going to start a business I don't.want to be worth 30 million quid this is.you know this is ridiculous you know.nobody is going to say oh my God I don't.want to be multi multimillionaire.because in 20 years time I'll have to.pay 1% taxes but most Traders most.Traders are earning what most people.earn in lifetime Traders can earn in a.year most Traders don't stop talk about.that a lot in my book right so most.Traders just keep going entrepreneurs.are the same that they're motivated to.keep going but when you have Wealth.Advisors and investors saying do not.build a company in the UK because.they're anti- wealth L I'm not trying to.make the UK anti- wealth I'm not trying.to make the UK and anti wealth I think.the UK and the US need to be looking at.a situation where you cannot allow.people who own enormous businesses that.sell to your country to live in Dubai to.live in the Cayman Islands and not pay.tax and I I don't think that's a.controversial position I've got a.question for both of you which is if you.are a young person and you're 18 years.old now and that you're listening to.this but your objective really is an.individualistic one you want to get rich.and you have a great future for you and.your family like all all of us have been.able to do what would your advice be to.them Gary at this moment in time this is.such a hard question I know Dan's angry.at me for what I put in my video how to.get rich um somebody came around to my.house and asked me this other day.obviously I get asked it a lot because.stupidly I'm very public about the fact.that I'm rich um what I did is not.replicable what I did is not replicable.it's not I'm sorry I'm sorry but it's.not people always say why don't you.teach me to trade like it's hard it's.hard trading and it's dangerous and I.think a lot of young men are getting.sort of sold into trading and becoming.gambling addicts um.you know work hard and I would I.wouldn't even say don't become an.entrepr I've never ever said these.things work hard you know if you think.that you have an opportunity in Tech.entrepreneurship go for it understand.it's risky I think that sometimes this.message just become an entrepreneur and.you make it is a bit dangerous because I.think most people who try to become.entrepreneurs fail and I think it's.super super dangerous the reality is and.you know maybe D like this maybe you.won't like this I think it is very very.difficult for a young man or a young.woman from a poor family to become rich.and I think it's increasingly hard even.to just get those basics of Financial.Security so listen obviously reduce your.spending if you can don't buy into this.like Balenciaga stay away from.that.but work hard study hard try to get a.good job but also understand we are.shrinking the seats on the Lifeboat.that's what we're doing we used to allow.50% to be secure then it's 40% then it's.30% then it's 20% you know you got.family in Nigeria if a young person from.like shanty town in Nigeria I came to.you and said Stephen what could I do to.get rich you would have to say to him.realistically listen you are in a.difficult situation here you need to.work really really hard but if you are.able to make enough money to to support.a family be proud of yourself what I.would actually say to them so yeah I.have got family in Nigeria um for people.that don't know I'm by Blood half.Nigerian I would say to them that.knowledge is really your life raft so.obviously there's a big Tech boom.happening in Nigeria which is liberating.a lot of people from that situation so I.would try and tell them to get on the.life raft that is like knowledge of this.new Revolution so from Nigeria you can.learn to code and then the the great.thing now is that we're we literally.have actually this is quite interesting.we're building a tech company in San.Francisco called flight cast it's live.everyone can go look at at flight.com.and the lead developer oh and guest.radar the lead developer of guest radar.is a Nigerian guy but how many of those.jobs in the Nigerian Tech sector are.going to kids that grew up in the shanty.towns I have no idea cuz I worked in.people ask me tell me how to do what you.did all right I worked in Canary Warf.it's in East London I could see the.building from my house going up there.was not a single other kid from East.London the whole time I was there do you.know to Dan's point about this remote.work Revolution where like work now has.you can work from anywhere and in our.company third web San Francisco me some.of the stuff that we now have are in the.Philippines because they just have like.great creatives there it's obviously.more cost effective isn't this a huge.part of what's going on in our economy.this this digitalization and this.remotify B your workers in the.Philippines very very well.um most of these people they used to.have a half decent wage on office and.now they're locked in their bedrooms.barely paying the bills yeah um in the.Philippines not in the Philippines the.Philippine guys are balling out control.no I'm saying the Philippines is booming.at the moment so you think the average.person in the Philippines is living a.luxurious life have you if you uh what's.happening at the moment do you think the.average person in the Philippines is.living a luxurious life there is there.is this thing called remote foreign.workers and this is a huge boom and the.economic the kidchen move to the.Philippines then it's great you get.great quality of life in the Philippines.you know when I looked at the thums of.Manila they should just get J they I.don't know why they're not getting the.laptops out uh the the poverty in the.Philippines is horrific I'm listen.Philippines a beautiful country an.amazing country I love the Philippines.number in there at at a rate that's.never what is the life like for your.average Filipino well would you agree.though that their economy is just.getting flooded with money at the moment.like money is flowing in there money is.flowing in but it is not giving a good.quality of life your average Filipino.that's not true remote foreign workers.well we can remote foreign workers.Filipino viewers to tell us.what's can actually support the often.support their en a look I don't know.what the average wages in the phili just.to bring it back to this point though so.I wanted to know from Gary he said work.hard if you're a young guy listening to.this now um I was reading this really.interesting article yesterday from the I.think it was from major newspaper.talking about the lost boys and it goes.to show that I think it's one in seven.young men that is at a working age now.are out of work so there's lots of talk.around young men in particular and how.they're struggling you'd say work hard.Gary You' say work hard no blena but the.big thing the big thing is recognize the.situation that you're in and I would.encourage them to support my work and.follow my channel because the lifeboats.are shrinking and trust me we're going.to get out kids in the lifeboats and we.all know that all right and if those.life boates are shrinking if you don't.if you don't stop the from going.down it is not you and you and me who.are going to go down we will be fine if.you don't fight the political fight I.guarantee you people like Daniel will so.you're saying that they should also get.involved in the political fight you have.to you have to that's what our.grandparents did Grand if they want to.become millionaires like you and me and.Dan well it sounds like Dan's got better.advice for that than I do okay well I'm.going to ask Dan as well but I just.wondering I'm wondering how your your.advice ties into sort of.like the young the young person who's.trying to liberate themselves from where.you came from or where I came from you.know what I don't think I'm the guy to.say that man because you know I had this.unusual gift from a young age I was very.very very good at maths and I just.followed that um and you know you know.my sister she's a poet and she wrote a.really successful Grime of musical about.DIY R's first album all right she comes.from obviously the same family as me.poor family she works so hard she works.so so hard two degrees she can barely.pay the rent all right so I don't want.to turn around to our young kids and say.well I've got this Talent follow your.talent because it doesn't work Stephen.true it doesn't work yeah wait my sister.does great work but financially for.young people following your passion.following your talent unless you come.from Rich family realistically very very.really works and I know it worked for.the three of us at this table but let's.not pretend that everyone experiences.the same things that we experienced what.would you say to that D and what's your.answer I think there's two economies.going on at the moment there's a dying.economy which is the Industrial.Revolution economy um and that is all.the office jobs and the factory jobs and.all of that sort of stuff which is very.much being automated away and moved.globally um and at the same time there's.this new bubbling up digital economy um.which I'd call the entrepreneur economy.or the digital economy um both of these.economies are kind of Co coexisting.one's going like that one's going uh.like that um and if you want to be.economically successful you need to.stand next to the biggest piles of money.that you can um you know unfortunately.being a poet uh doesn't pay a lot of.money and we all know that that's not a.surprise if you came from a very rich.family and you were a poet you'd.probably be one of the 60% who fell out.of a rich family uh as well um if you.want to be economically successful you.need to say what is the thing that's.economically booming right now Gary saw.the finance industry at that particular.time but if we actually look at the.finance industry now it's in Decline um.and trading is being rep uh replaced by.AI robots um people who worked in your.career are going to be replaced by uh it.systems that basically do similar jobs.it's going to be you know these things.happen we're going through a massive uh.technological change but at the same.time it's never been easier to learn.skills for free uh on YouTube it's never.been easier to join communities where.you can get mentoring and get support.there are communities of angel investors.who do invest in in startups uh it's.never been cheaper or easier to start a.company there's never been more software.and Technology to scale and grow you.know in just a in a short space of time.I would say do what Gary's done Gary.publishes online he's built a personal.brand he's attached it to a recurring.Revenue model uh he's got yeah I also.worked for three for free for four years.I'm not sure how replicable that is you.know so build a personal brand attach it.to a business model that is that is.where money is Flowing um these are.these are positive things you can do we.all have to play the cards we're dealt.you can always find someone who's done.better with better cards or someone.who's been dealt better cards and you.can always find someone who's been dealt.worse a cards no matter who you are on.the planet there's someone better.there's someone worse you have to play.the cards that you dealt you cannot sit.around waiting for the economic system.of the world to be changed you have to.say you know what these are the cards I.was born at this particular time in this.these circumstances these are my.strengths these are my weaknesses I'm.going to play the cards that i' I've.dealt um personal agency is what gets.people to feel good about their life to.make progress and as soon as you play.the victim mindset soon as you say oh.you know what the answer to all my.prayers is Gary's going to change the.system uh you're in serious trouble can.I just say one thing back on that um if.we become a society of of individuals.who think only individually and and.never consider broader societal problems.we will become a society that becomes.unable to fix societal.problems I'm somebody who has made.millions of pounds betting on the.collapse of society the collapse of the.middle class um I don't want to be.giving stock tips on the Titanic okay I.I understand I understand that we live.in individualized societies and and it's.not popular to say hey you need to.protect your Society um if you don't.protect your Society your Society is.going to collapse and and the British.public the American public have a choice.to make here here to protect these what.do you want people to do I want them to.get involved with watch my channel.subscribe to my channel content on.YouTube Instagram Tik Tok share it with.your friends share it with your mom.understand and then push for change push.for change like our grandparents did.push the politicians to tax working.people less and tax extremely wealthy.wealth orders more so vote for the.greens vote for whoever gives you that.whoever gives you your share of the PIP.basic listen this is not football okay.I'm not here M of the GRE I'm here to.protect the working class so that's.their sort of that would be their social.and sort of um political energy would be.to stand up and fight but in their in.their personal lives are you telling.them to start businesses take big risks.work really hard go for it because they.can also I would defer to you guys on.that you know I'm not a businessman I'm.an economist that's what I am you know I.made my money by being an economist I'm.a very very good Economist my.predictions will be right people can go.and watch my predictions at the.beginning of covid I predicted the.entire Co crisis exactly correctly in.May 2020 you know this is you know I'm.good at this I'm and listen I'm never.going to come here and say I'm a better.businessman than you and I don't I'm.pretty sure that I'm not I'm a very very.very good Economist this will happen is.there something that I can do if I'm sat.here listening at home I understand.everything you said I believe everything.you said I I I believe that it's going.to get worse for me do you think I.should still take responsibility of my.situation and fight to make my life.richer better moreful 100% 100 100% cuz.you you know and I'm sure you know if.you're average British or American if.you don't do that you're not going to be.able to turn the heating on you have to.do it you have to do it and I've never.once you I think my opinions are often.mischaracterized to being anti- ambition.you've read my book do you think I'm.anti- ambition no I work my tits off to.make money and I want every single young.person in this country to be able to.make money if they want to if that's.what they want to work towards but we've.created a society where it's almost.impossible for young listen I've been.there I've been at LC I've been at.Oxford I've been in the city I've been.in the media I've been in politics all.all of the guys at the top are a bunch.of Rich idiots we are not allowing these.smart kids from ordinary backgrounds to.get into those spaces why why do we.pretend we're not doing that do that I.disagree with that you're talking about.two types of elite spaces Elite space of.elite universities yeah and you're.talking about the elite space of.derivatives trading there's the real.economy yeah where entrepreneurs do.their work then there's the first.derivative which is the banking system.and then there's the second derivative.which is rates Traders like yourself.right these are these These are places.that normal people don't want to end up.most normal people who grow up in normal.households don't uh wake up one day and.say I want to be a rates Trader on a.double derivative of the economy making.bets most people want to start a.business that employs people and they.want to grow that business and be.successful do you think that starting a.business is a realistic High success.probability chance of ordinary poor.people becoming rich I I know that.economies Thrive when entrepreneurs are.active.and it's not just the entrepreneurs they.create is our viewers can do and most of.them will end up rich you only need 1%.to improve the whole economy there's a.really interesting stat that says.globally around 65% of ultra high net.worth individuals are.self-made approximately 19% primarily.primarily inherited their wealth and.about 16% inherited wealth but.significantly grew it through their own.Ventures so 65% of the ultra high worth.individuals globally are self-made does.that not mean that if I want to become.an ultra high Networth person it's going.to come down to listen we are just come.off the back of the golden age of.capitalism when ordinary people like my.dad you know I grew up in ilford it's in.East London it's a very immigrant area.most of my friends I grew up with come.from Pakistani Indian immigrant.backgrounds they come over with nothing.they worked really hard they made money.they had their own assets we had a.period where Ordinary People could make.money and could make wealth so obviously.we are now in a period where there are.rich people who made money during that.period but it's over now I'm seeing.ordinary people making money all the.time okay so you're telling our viewers.they're idiots why are they not making.money I'm not telling anyone they're an.idiot I'm saying that if it's that easy.okay all right fine go and buy Dan's.book read it and become a millionaire.because Dan thinks it's easy to become a.millionaire being an entrepreneur but I.suspect having not been an entrepreneur.that most of the people who've read your.book are not millionaires everything.you've touched has turned to Gold you.turned yourself to Academia you got an.amazing qualification you turned.yourself to banking you became 2 million.a year you turned yourself to being a.writer you become Sunday Times.bestseller you turn yourself to content.creating you get 800,000 followers and.you and now you sit there after all of.that evidence and say oh no it's all.over guys it's all I'm smart enough to.do it but you guys are not smart enough.to do if if you think you can teach.you've got your book if you think you.canach you say you're smart enough but.they're not smart enough I I wonder if.um we do have a bit of an education.problem at the at the heart of this.because I was thinking about your sister.and I was like right if I was the CEO of.Gary's sister what would I do there's.two things I do right now the first is.okay where's where what what Marketplace.is really valuing an ability to write.and write an impactful way I go write.you need to start an Instagram page.because I've seen what happened with J.sh this guy's pulling in tens of.millions a year because he took like you.know nice words that were motivational.poetic put them on there and I also.YouTube needs to get to YouTube because.if she can talk like you then she's.going to do exceptionally well on.YouTube as well um but the old there's.not going to be a great economy.necessarily for someone who's doing.poetry in many other places other than.one I'm saying is the internet but in.school we don't teach this there's no.YouTube class for YouTube and and it's.such a huge part of the economy I mean I.mean me and you have seen that it's.there's been this decentralization of.media where the megaphone was growing at.20% a year the me the megaphone was.people watching start a YouTube become.ENT it's the Internet isn't e I'm not.say works for most people stepen for.most people no it doesn't work it.doesn't work why are we pretending it.does but I what what I what I would say.is if in school we taught young kids a.couple new things and we stopped.teaching them about Pythagoras's Theorem.which by the way chat gbt is going to do.for you with your eyes closed and we.taught them about the new economy of the.internet about the ability to start a.shop and I it's crazy that I the school.system was designed in such a way where.they put me in exclusion unit because I.was so preoccupied with doing business.deals at school and my Headmaster came.on T National TV on what I lied to and.said yeah we unexp beled him eventually.because he made the school so much money.but the system was punishing me for.Entre for entrepreneurship and it wasn't.teaching me anything about the the new.economy which is which is technology St.do you think it matters if the.percentage of young people who are able.to Achieve Financial Freedom and have a.family is shrinking so do I think it.matters if the percentage of young.people that are able.to are you saying attain wealth and have.a family yeah Achieve Financial Freedom.and have a family I think that's a.really big problem listen I think that's.a really big problem I agree I know.listen and I know you've got this.podcast and I know you inspire young.people and I think that's a good thing I.think it's a good thing that you inspire.young people to go out and work hard and.try and Achieve something but I'm an.economist and what I see is the.percentage of young people who make it.shrinking and I think if you combine.those two things you reach a really.dangerous place because we go and tell.the young people it's there for you to.start a business and at the same time.the number of people who make it is 10%.5% 2% 1% and there will always be that.one person who makes it there will.always be that Steven Bartley in every.country in the world who's making it.through you know what I'm saying but the.systematic issue matters Stephen C can.we can we not change the education.system so that when I was 16 and they.threw me in the exclusion unit which.made me which would could so easily have.made me think that I was a failure.because my brothers who went Jason went.to LSC okay and became very much like.you and now works in my company um.managing my investments he in that.education system was rewarded so I sat.there as a kid thinking rich and.successful my older brother Jason.because he can do maths and I thought.I'm going to be a failure because I like.this thing called entrepreneurship and I.have ADHD so I can't pay attention in.lessons what I'm saying is if the.education system was designed in such a.way where people like me who were.entrepreneurial who were interested in.the internet and couldn't stop playing.video games were clapped for and said oh.my God double down on that yeah um I.think the net benefit when you think.about what the backbone of the economy.is which is entrepreneurs starting.businesses would be profound for this.country here yeah but that but but I I.think that I believe there needs to be.such a radical overhaul of our education.system if we want to stand a chance of.capitalizing on what the economy is.today yeah I I think I think you could.probably change the education system in.a lot of ways that could improve it but.you're kind of changing the education.system on the Titanic what my my.perspective is I can tell you with a.very very high rate of certainty if you.don't fix this problem of the wealth.being sucked out of the middle class 95.98% of people will be in poverty in this.country in 70 years I agree with you.this is the thing I agree that you can't.have a group of people at the very top.that own all the assets and all the.money or else I mean it's going to come.from somewhere and I remember the day.that I printed off the jobseekers.allowance form when I was stealing.Chicago town piz 10 years ago in my room.in Mosside in Manchester I remember what.it feels like to not have my parents.speaking to me to be have all these ccj.letters and baith letters on my desk and.really have no answer how how to get out.of the situation to the point that I was.like shoplifting I'd call the justy.driver and then trying to persuade him.just to give me the food that was that.was that was 10 years ago for me so I I.it's not I've not forgotten the the.those years of my life so I understand.what it is to be in that situation and.on an individual level I need need some.answers because I'm not going to wait.for these people in the.parliament to fix my life for me so I.need some individual answers and then I.do also care about the bigger picture so.I'm not like here as someone that just.wants to acrew loads of wealth myself of.course listen let's be honest no one.like there's not many human beings that.wouldn't like more money so I try and.acknowledge that bias but what I'm the.the the the big issue I have is is is.how and from my personal experience as.someone that now employs hundreds and.hundreds and hundreds of people here in.London up in Manchester in our offices I.there are a set of things that would.make me leave this country if it became.increasingly less uh friendly to.entrepreneurs I reckon if we come back.here in 5 years time I reckon I'll.employ 500 more people in the UK and.actually as you look around this room.you can see the age of them these are.young people yeah um there are things.you could do to make me not do that I.mean it's probably worth pointing out.that we're not taxing wealth and you're.leaving the country anyway Stephen no I.haven't left the country okay you're.going I'm I'm a tax resident here I pay.my taxes here and I have zero intent in.changing that I'm also on Dragon you.know so we're investing a lot of money.in UK businesses but listen I want to.raise I want to tax only high levels of.wealth only high levels of wealth and.listen don't get me wrong I understand.very rich people will complain and very.rich people will say just like they did.in Dickens I'm going to throw my.businesses I'm going to throw my taxes.my my businesses and my factories into.the sea Stephen your viewers are here.you listen Steven your viewers are here.you are a very wealthy person they are.are paying 20 30 40 50% you should be.paying your fair share Stephen you.should I think that I should.pay more tax especially when um I don't.think my kids should get should should.benefit from my wealth and maybe this is.a controversial opinion but I actually.don't I don't think I should be able to.pass down my assets to my children you.can't it's 40% tax I think it should be.more 4 yeah let's not pretend rich.people don't successfully pass their ass.their children I'm just telling you now.I do think I'd be robbing my children of.something from the background that I.came from if my CH my child gets.if my child has gets tens of millions.let's say even when I die I don't think.that should happen well I agree people.say when I talk about my sister people.like why don't you just give your sister.a load of money listen my sister works.hard she's a smart person she works hard.she produces good work I want to live in.a society where people like my sister.are able to support themselves with the.work that they do but we we're.destroying that Society who would pay.her the the customers you know this the.situ so you want her to start a business.she is a business yeah yeah and I want.people like her to be to be taxed less.so that what I want is ordinary working.people to be tax less so they have more.money in their pocket listen the reason.we had the thriving art scene in the 60s.is because we had a thriving middle.class that could go and buy the new.fashions and buy the new records and.then that created this thriving art.scene now we have a middle class which.is struggling to pay the bills so they.can't they can't buy stuff they you know.my syst makes theater shows the only.people who go to the theater are rich.people now but back back in the day you.know theater was something that was more.accessible you want you want the Arts.I've got to mate use a fashion designer.right nowadays there's all of the.business is super fast super cheap super.disposable fashion or unbelievably.expensive high-end because that's the.economy we've created I want you go to.Japan which is a less unequal Society.the restaurants are good quality.restaurants for ordinary people because.a good capitalist Society will produce.things for the people with money in the.case of theater where have the theater.consumers moved to where are they.getting their entertainment now well.what you have is a very rich group of.people who will still go to the theater.and they will pay a lot but then you.have a large group of people who are.relatively cash scarce and they will try.to get their entertainment in cheaper.ways of course you know what I mean.they're spending their time watching.your YouTube channel well exactly my you.which is Free by the way yeah but you.get paid from it you get the YouTube.Honest it's only in the last couple of.months that I started to make any money.because I don't do my own um editing so.and you I mean you'll know but in the.first few years you're paying yourself.to do it you know what I mean like I.think people some times massively.overestimate the amount of money this is.entrepreneurs entrepreneurs go through 2.three four 5 years worth of struggle to.get to the point where they're.successful and it feels pretty horrific.that you say oh finally when I make it.you take it um and then the advisers to.entrepreneurs just 10 million is quite a.lot of money so you know you can be.worth 9 million and not be paying.anything more but what if I just raise 1.million for investment into my company.but that then like I do if I'm if if I'm.raising money all the way along and my.investors are saying I'm sorry I don't.invest in the UK economy because it's.wealth taxes and all that sort of stuff.it's anti- wealth uh and then I just.have to move my company overseas well I.want to create a situation where the UK.consumer is so strong that you have to.invest in the UK you don't have to be.here to sell to.them if you're looking to take the next.step in your Tech Career you'll want to.hear about our sponsor

our sponsor whoop a.business I'm also an investor in and if.you follow me on Instagram you probably.noticed that recently I've picked up.running which I'm very much enjoying and.it started out as a challenge but it's.now evolved into something I do almost.daily it is one of those things that's.pushing me to be better every single day.but here's the thing to me progress.isn't just about pushing harder it's.also about training in a smarter way.which is where my whoop comes in whoop.doesn't just track my workouts it tells.me how ready my body is to take them on.before I've even started the workout a.few years ago we ran a study called.project p are and it found that Runners.who adjusted their training based on.their recovery scores improved their 5K.times by an average of 2 minutes and 40.seconds while reducing injury Risk by.over 30% and they did it while training.less so if you're looking for this type.of guidance when it comes to your.training head over to join. woop.com CEO.and get a 30-day trial with zero.commitment that's join. woop.com.CEO let me know how you get on so so do.we all agree on this premise though that.Gary's saying which is the very the.ultra Rich which we can classify as.being worth more than you're saying we.say 10 10 million is the line that we.campaign for okay we we think that they.should pay a greater share of the tax.and then the qu if you agree with that.premise the question then becomes yes.but how yeah well they already do 1% pay.30% I want to be clear that's the top 1%.of taxpayers which is not the top 1% of.richest people mind you I'm also not.necessarily saying um what's fair I'm.saying what's practically possible right.so like you could you could come up with.the world's most Fair on a back of a.napkin this is what's fair but whether.you can implement it is a very difficult.thing the problem is wealth is.completely mobile now it's really you.can live work from.anywhere the houses Dan yeah it's land.is that mobile you going rip you can't.rip the country out of the out of the.sea there's very few I've never met any.seriously wealthy people who own a lot.of houses you honestly think that the.entire housing stock of the UK is not.valuable yeah no it is but 78% is owned.by Baby Boomers they just own they've.they've bought a house in 1992 they own.the house personally I think that that.house ownership especially when you.consider mortgages is relatively.unequally distributed that is by the way.the most equally distribut young people.have now had the commercial property the.land the natural by Pension funds so.you're the viewers own it do they no.they're owned by if they own a pension.fun most of those commercial what the.distribution of Pion what is the.distribution of Pensions what percentage.of Pensions is owned by top 1% the I.wouldn't know off the top of my head but.with pensions but I know I know that OB.obviously wealth concentrates at the top.but here's the one thing keep in mind.wealthy group are not necessarily a.static group there was a study of the.richest people in 1900 and most of those.families are poor today or they they've.gone down in value today uh if the.richest people in 1900 had have just.simply kept their wealth there'd be.16,000 more billionaires but but they.they don't um you know in Wealth.Management in Banks yeah they have this.thing called the um succession planning.so succession planning is where they try.and figure out how to not to screw it up.across generations and they're they're.notoriously bad at it it's very hard to.keep wealth in Generations down in the.20th.century we had two world wars and a.holocaust that redistributed.wealth I would prefer not to have that.again yeah yeah yeah I'm with you I want.a affluent middle class I I really do so.where's the we going to come from you.want to just you're going to create your.entrepreneurs.entrepreneur entrepreneur economies that.are friendly towards wealth creation and.Entrepreneurship was the last time you.had a government that wasn't let's grow.let's grow let's.grow it's not working for the people.Daniel no the problem is is that they.need to step back they need to let.shrink let shrink let shrink our viewers.should keep close ey on Donald Trump and.Elon Musk because they're doing what.you're asking it'll be interesting to.see what happens right it's too soon to.tell if you were trying to grow the UK.economy would you not take America.approach because they seem to be much.more successful at growing growing their.economy I think I mean of course when we.talk about slashing of the state they're.going to use these examples like oh.there's this wasteful government.building everybody wants to slash.government waste of course I'm not going.to fight against slashing government.waste um I'm from the UK you know I saw.the austerity years I've seen what's.happened to local Services I've seen.what's happened to things like the.police like like education you know.especially things like Youth Services um.you slash the state you fire a load of.people you know.what does the state okay yeah if you can.get rid of State corruption yes 100% if.you can get rid of State waste 100% you.know this is how single moms feed their.kids.Stephen you want to stop that no I'm.saying that slashing the.state I don't think it's going to work.um to be honest I think tariffs is is.not an uninteresting discussion I think.yeah of course tax avoidance is.something you need to get rid of really.I would like to take a step back look at.the country and say what is the state of.the country what what the people need.you know we have a country here where.the housing stock is falling apart and.we're letting it fall apart because.those houses are owned by ordinary.people who don't have any money if you.want the country to work for ordinary.people you need Ordinary People to have.money I'm always reminded of Mr Beast he.goes to places in Africa and he spends.500 quid and he gives a kid eyesight who.would have been blind for the rest of.their life for 500 quid why are kids in.Africa blind who could be given sight.for 500 quid because they don't have any.money this is what happens when you.drain your middle class you this will.end up like that you know you know I've.got a friend who went to India last week.he said there were people lying on the.street outside with rotting limbs you.know that is what happens when you when.you disempower when you take the money.away from your middle class you've got.to protect the middle class if the.middle class had money then there would.be unbelievable business opportunities.for selling goods and services like your.business to the middle class so would.you tax Daniel more.I don't know if Daniel's worth more than.10 million pounds it sounds like he is.um is I mean I think I want to make it.clear right you people you make 5% on.your wealth so if Daniel's worth 100.million he's making £5 million we're.only trying to tax you 1% I think if you.are worth 100 million you're making 5.million pound passive income you can.afford to pay a million pound tax a year.you're going to still keep getting rich.the truth is even if we were to tax.these billionaires 1% a year they would.still squeeze the rest out this is not.this is not about morality this is just.cold hard economic analysis that I have.made a lot of money betting on so.closing arguments then chaps um I'll.start with you Gary based on everything.we've discussed today um what is I'm.going to ask you to to give me two.perspectives which is if I'm a young.individual in this country right now.what should I do to protect myself and.my family and to feed my family what.kind of behaviors what strategy should I.drop there but also then from a.government level I know we have some.politicians that listen because they.message me what should politicians be.doing to to fix the issue that we're all.clearly identify which is the collaps of.the middle class the collaps of sort of.working-class people and the the the.increased wealth of the rich I think.what I would like young people to.understand is that this gets worse this.getss much much worse it will get much.worse um relatively quickly uh poverty.will increase relatively quickly it will.become.increasingly difficult almost impossible.to make any serious money prepare.yourself for that prepare yourself when.you consider your finances when you.consider your plans for having a family.um.this gets worse and it's going to be.really really hard it's going to be a.big mental health problem for a lot of.young people um so speak to people and.understand that um my YouTube videos are.there G's economics people don't.understand what's happening um after.that you've got to do all the right.things yeah I mean I don't disagree with.you you've got to work hard you've got.to study the right things um I I think.it's a great shame we have made subjects.like the Arts um a thing which you.you're not allowed if you come from po.poor backgrounds you cannot work in arts.I'm sorry you can't pay the bills you.can't so you have to go and study Ai and.Computing and you know maybe social.media although we have to be honest.social media doesn't pay for most people.um you have to realize the reality of.your situation it's very very very very.bad that doesn't mean you don't work.that doesn't mean you don't Aspire you.work damn hard because you have to but.if you manage to make enough money to.even support a family you should be.proud of yourself that that's the number.one thing um but.recognize this can be changed this can.be changed our grandparents our.great-grandparents fought for our.biggest share of the pie and they got it.they got Healthcare they got education.they got housing they got food our young.people can have that as well but they.won't get it unless they fight for it so.I would encourage people.to educate themselves support my work.get involved politically but also work.hard support your friends and family try.and make money because you'll have.to if you don't play politics I.guarantee you the other side will play.politics and that means your kids and.your grandkids live in poverty so you.have to do both with regards to.politicians um I got mixed feelings.about a lot of politicians the truth is.I think a lot of politicians are very.rich and and ultimately they don't care.they're protected a crisis of inequality.looks fantastic from the top and I think.that's why the three of us can sit here.and say things will be fine because for.us they will be fine and for our kids.they will be fine but for our viewers.kids they won't be fine um the.politicians are not going to try and.save you I'm going to try and make sure.they do it but I don't think they will.listen my plan is not to get concessions.from politicians my plan is to get 5.million followers on the internet and.Bully the politicians so that they have.to give us what we need so I would.support people to get behind me get.behind my campaign but also understand.what's happening educate your friends.and your family and just crucially to.understand this is going to be a long.fight so be strong keep your people.around you but be ready for what's to.come I am I see hint and some of the.things you've said recently of you going.into politics yourself at some point.Stephen I'm in politics but I me.politics actively listen I I do not want.to be an MP I do not want to be.Chancellor I do not want to be prime.minister if we get to a point where I.feel that that is something that is.achieved when is the best way to fix.this problem I will be open to it this.is not plan a this is not you know would.you like to be prime minister I suspect.probably not right like this is I'll be.honest I I am quite uncomfortable with.even the level of um public profile that.I have at the moment which is you know.it's much less than what you have but it.stresses me out and it's weird we spoke.about it before we were shooting um I.don't want to can you imagine I I don't.want to be prime minister I don't want.to be an MP um but I'm serious about.this work that I do and if we reach a.point that I think that is the best way.to do it I will consider it but I would.much rather be able to influence the MPS.from the sideline to influence the.politicians from the sidelines and for.that person you just gave advice to who.should they be voting for well we don't.have an election for listen.politics is not football politics is not.football okay this is not about I'm.labor I'm conservative I'm Republican.I'm Democrat you're losing your houses.here you you're losing your houses your.kids will be in poverty and you're going.to see both Trump and the Republicans.and Karma and labor who are supposed to.be on the opposite side of the political.spectrum they will both fail because.they will not take action on growing.wealth inequality and I'll be right on.that you know bring me back in a few.years I'll be right on that and um that.shows you it's not about I think this.factionalism is unbelievable damaging to.our societies especially in the US where.there's so much hatred behind it where.suddenly I'm on this side you're on that.side we're going to shake hands after.this nothing we will you know it's.there's no hatred here but if you allow.yourself to be divided from half of your.country and you allow we're seeing it.growing tensions racial tensions gender.tensions if you allow yourself to be.divided they will win they will win so.you need to vote for whoever is going to.protect your houses and if you want to.know who that is come and check Gary's.economics before the election and I will.tell you who it's going to be.Daniel nice closing arguments personal.and social a a few things um I read.Gary's bookin it's brilliant and.regardless of um regardless of whether.you actually like economics it's a.brilliant story it's a really I read it.in about two or three days um and it'll.it'll eventually be a good movie as well.um I agree with a lot of what Gary's.saying um there is a collapse of the.middle class uh and it probably will get.worse uh and the traditional middle.class jobs that came out of the back of.the Industrial Age mature Industrial.Revolution system th those are.collapsing and it's globalizing we're.seeing technology move opportunities all.over the world um and wealth inequality.it has a cause uh wealth inequality.itself is a scoreboard and there's a.cause for what led up to wealth.inequality and the cause in my mind is.technology technology is moving the.those opportunities around and it's.changing things we already have big.governments we have huge amounts of.taxes we're at record levels of tax taes.um uh wealth has never been more mobile.it's not about what's fair it's about.what you can practically get away with.it's about what you can actually.Implement um and uh it's going to be.very very as Gary said it's going to be.very very very hard to tax people who.have digital businesses who can live and.work from anywhere I know that firsthand.um that it's incredibly mobile with that.said at a micro level oh sorry at a.macro level big picture we do know that.there is a correlation between economic.freedom where the government gets out of.your way and low poverty rates and we.know that as soon as governments become.big uh high taxes High regulations it.actually drops down a category and we.see poverty goes up from 10% to 30% so.triples um so constricting economic.freedom is never a good idea uh if you.look at the data at a micro level.there's never been a greater opportunity.for anyone who's ambitious and.entrepreneurial to go and start a.company it's cheaper than ever to start.a company you can do what Gary's done.which is publish content build a.following uh figure out how to monetize.it uh you can create products and.services and sell them to anywhere in.the world um you're an example of.someone who started with nothing and.became a millionaire in your 20s and.then again in your 30s with a completely.different thing he became a millionaire.in his 20s and then again in his 30s.is's a bestselling author and a content.creator I did it in my 20s my 30s and.now my 40s um starting from scratch so.it's it's not normal that three guys our.agage could have done that over and over.again it's because we are living in a.time where there is incredible.opportunities but you have to be tapped.into those opportunities you never heard.about it at school you never heard about.it at University you're going to have to.learn the skills to get tapped into.those OPP opportunities but there are.definitely ways that you can succeed in.the world that we're living in and on.that macro Point who should we be voting.for because some of your thinking in.policy suggestions through this.conversation align more with Trump Elon.the American Mission now where they're.welcoming millionaires they're trying to.create a really entrepreneurship.friendly environment they're doing the.Doge dismantling of sort of government.waste I I agree with Gary it's not.football you don't have a team you swing.you should be a swing voter you should.vote every single election you should.make them work hard for your vote and.you should is Trump going to succeed.though you should see it's too soon to.tell but he made a prediction so I'm.inviting you to make a prediction he.said five years time we come back here.we're going to see that Trump I think I.think a lot of very wealthy people are.going to move move to the USA um you're.going to get a lot of people from all.over the world he's playing to win and.he wants rich people and entrepreneurs.and investors to come into the US and be.based there he's creating golden visas.and open visas and the success metric.here is the middle class get richer and.more affluent what I actually think will.happen as a result of all of that you.will see Rising living standards in the.USA and you'll see a detriment to the.places where those people live it's not.a good thing to have the people who pay.the majority of the taxes which is 1% of.people paying 30% of taxes if those.people leave the bills get spread across.everybody else well we'll have to do a.part two and we shall see um I want to.thank you both for the work that you do.because I'm a big fan of both of you I.watch Gary's videos all the time helps.me to understand another perspective on.what I'm typically hearing out out on.the Internet or that I hear on Twitter.about what's going on in the world and I.think I really respect and admire people.that can do what both of you have done.today which is to exchange and listen to.ideas in the pursuit of answers uh and.that's why I'd highly recommend anybody.regardless of whether you agree with.everything or some things or or or just.a little bit to go and follow Gary's.Channel on YouTube called Gary's.economics because it's a great source of.information from someone who has done it.from understands the world from another.perspective but also someone who's.providing a narrative which I actually.think there's we kind of talked about.before you started there's a big gap in.the market for there are a lot of people.like me and Dan out on the internet that.are talking about entrepreneurship and.finance and how to make money but there.aren't enough people talking about.wealth inequality from the perspective.as Gary sees.um and that are providing more sort of.uh collectivist and sort of society.wide Solutions and answers and sort of.explanations as to why that's ultimately.happening I do think I do think because.I know you Dan I hope I know myself I do.think that we we all want the UK to.survive and I think we all believe that.the way that the UK survives isn't.necessarily a couple of ultra rich.people getting more money it is sort of.social mobility and it's allowing people.that are at the very bottom to create.opportunities and to succeed we all.agree upon that even if we agree.disagree sorry on the causes and the.solutions to that um I'd also highly.recommend everybody to go check out the.trading game because everybody's talking.about this this book and I think it's.what four weeks at the moment on the.Sunday Times besteller list four weeks.number one number one four weeks number.one which is an incredible achievement.but it speaks to what's in this book the.way that the story is told but also the.timeliness of this message so I'd highly.recommend everybody to go check it out.I'm going to put a link below so that.everybody can go and do it and if you.just look at some of the um the the.testimonials for this book it's profound.I hear people describe it as like.Unforgettable on one end and then sad on.the other end because that's the nature.of the reality it speaks to and I highly.recommend everybody to go check out Dan.priestley's entreprene Revolution but.also your website has all of your.resources and tools on it so I'll link.that on the screen what's the uh Danel.priest.com Danel priest.com thank you.both for your generosity really really.appreciate it thanks for bringing us.together no matter where in the world it.seems like everyone is drinking matcha.and there's a good chance that that.matcha you're drinking is made by a.company that I've invested more than.seven figures in who are a sponsor of.this podcast called perfect Ted because.they're the brand used globally by cafes.like blank Street Coffee and Joe and the.juice and many many more not only can.you get perfect Ted match in cafes but.you can now also make it at home much.cheaper in seconds using our flavored.matcha powders that I have here in front.of me perfect Ted matcher is ceremonial.grade and source from Japan it is smooth.it is naturally sweet not like those.bitter grassy matches that I tried.before perfect Ted and if you are one of.those people that have told yourself you.don't like matcha it's probably because.you haven't tried our perfect Ted matcha.and you can find perfect Ted matcha in.the UK and Tesco sainsbury Holland and.Barett and in waitrose or Albert Hine if.you're in the Netherlands and on Amazon.in the USA or'll get the full range.online at perfect ted.com where you can.get 40% off your first order with code.Steve even.40 this has always blown my mind a.little bit 53% of you that listen to.this show regularly haven't yet.subscribed to the show so could I

Gary Stevenson and Daniel Daniel are two leading experts in wealth.and Entrepreneurship and the economy to.discuss the state of the US the UK and the Western World. Gary Stevenson: I'm sick of multi-millionaires.telling kids who can't afford to turn.the heating on you just need to be more.entrepreneurial it's sick Dan. Daniel Daniel: If you allow the rich to get.richer they squeeze the middle class and.the poor class out of things like housing.Daniel was born in Botswana and grew up in a low-income family in Australia. He was City bank's most profitable.Trader in the world that year and he made.them just over $ 35 million you made. them $35 million you eventually decide.to leave City Bank. He now runs a business that predicts when interest rates will go back up.Gary says he's concerned that because of wealth INE equality.we're going to end up in a similar position to the likes of India. The UK went from an 82.when I arrived in 2006 went from 82 out.of 100 down to 68 out of 100 so we're.less economically free and predictably.what we will always see happen if you.lower people's economic freedom more poverty.At the beginning of Co. we knew governments.across the world would be giving out tens of trillions of pounds. Nobody discussed who was going to end up with that money. The UK government.deficit since the start of Co is is 1.trillion pounds US number is $4. Trillion that's you know £20,000 per UK adult.50% of the gains of the.S&P 500 is tech companies. The average American over 65 is living luxuriously. 78% of.housing wealth is in the hands of baby boomers. Government.massively inflated the value of homes.through debt so they just in injected.like low interest rates that you.involved in.The average British old person is.sitting on million millions of pounds of.cash not millions of cash no equity well.someone is on the other side of just one.say the difference the difference is if.you inflate the value of a house you.don't have cash you have a house that's.worth a lot of money. 78% of home.ownership wealth is in the hands of.people over 65 now it's baby boomergeneration.Stephen, Daniel and Gary discuss the economic future of the UK and the U.S. Gary: We're going to have a split test on this right. It seems like the us is.going to have less taxes and less.regulations. Daniel: I think that's an overly.simplified view of things that.has made me a multimillionaire.Gary Keen: The average Irish person lives well. The average US American will be.rich in years than the here what I trust. I trust economic freedom if people have.freedom they create better decisions for.their own life. Gary Keen: I blame.high taxes where they've because of high.taxes they can take out more debt they.can then inflate the economy.The UK has completely lost its technology industry. Our tech industry is in Decline. What would have previously been. good British jobs are getting moved.overseas to lower cost countries. The UK has a thousand.millionaires a month leaving to go to.Dubai we have 120,000 British people living in Dubai.Daniel O'Brien: The rich tax the owners not the workers. The PowerHouse is on the air tonight at 10pm ET on Channel 4. The debate is over whether or not the Duke of Westminster pays income tax on his income. Daniel: The issue that we have with the rich is that is the number one most valuable assets in the economy.The idea.with taxing billionaires at wealth.billionaires will just leave they just.get up and leave and and not justbillionaires.own what the billionaires own companies.and where do companies get their money.from revenues and where do the revenues.come from purchasing people purchasing. Where do those people live all over the world we can tax them at that point.10,800 high net.worth individuals left the UK which is.57% increase from the previous year. 1 millionaire is.departing every 45 minutes the UK. The top 10% of earners in the US.account for nearly half of all consumer.spending the top 1% of income taxpayers.in the UK are projected to contribute.about 30% of total income tax from 2024 to2025.I agree 100% it is difficult to tax.rich people it is very very very.difficult to tax rich people I don't I.don't come here saying I want to.tax rich people because it's easy I know.it's hard I know probably I'm going to.lose I know our viewers kids will live.in Desperate poverty I know that I do.this because it is hard.Startup entrepreneurs Jeff Bez is a lot.more than 10 million jez Jeff worth a.lot more than you talk about anyone. above 10 million is on your radar you.don't want people worth 11 million.pounds we pay more I'm not just talk. Dan: Is it fair that like who gets to.decide what wealth Is wealth and what.it's worth because wealth let's just hit.me out wealth is a a technical term forunrealized gains right it's not real uh.Daniel O'Brien: If the governments of our.countries cut taxes on us the three.multimillionaire sitting at this table.that will improve the lives of the.ordinary British and American give a.real life example to feed their kids. The most economically free the.Countries that get in the way of your.economic freedom have more poverty and.the countries that let people make.decisions for their own life.Stephen Fry: I worry as a.bystander that if we don't create.entrepreneurship friendly environments. We have those companies here we need.them here because China and the US are.dominating this next.Revolution um and I'm wondering why we can't create a better environment in the UK.Stephen Fry: We should reduce taxes on the.income that they make but then if they.start owning A50 million pound company. If you allow British people who own 300.million pound of British assets totechnically live in Monaco and not pay.tax then you will get crime and you will.have dirty streets.I think we.should stop obfuscating tax on people's.work from tax on the ass they uh so I'm.talking about entrepreneurs work.generates wealth so when if I if I ear a.billion pound of British houses yeah and.then I say I live in Dubai yeah.getting the rent on a billion pounds of.houses which would probably be something.like like 50 million a year. So I'm getting 60.50 60 million ayear of rent from.British people yeah and that gets paid.to me from British people yeah. and I pay.and I don't pay tax Ilive in Dubai do.you think that's fair no all right so.let's change that let's make.people pay tax on on their world.regardless where they live.Dan: For kids from poor.backgrounds it is almost.impossible to realistically get even.Financial Security never mind wealth but.why do you think you could do it I could.do it he could. But you don't think.other people could doing it well the first.thing is I'm 38 now so I'm not not a kid.nowadays um listen I want every Mass.competition I've ever been in you know.Daniel: I find it very strange that.you think it would be easier to fix the.entire global economic system than to.start a business and fix your own. Personal economics the the thing that gives people.mental health issues is feeling that.they have no agency in their life that they can't do anything.11% of 11% of working age people are now.declared too sick to work right we have.a huge problem in the UK we also have.25% of uh people who are working age.don't work uh it's one in seven men. I think the system is.collapsing do you think think the average British American working is.lazy what I think is happening is that.the technology companies are totallytransforming and disrupting everything.I think personal agency is broadly.applicable the idea I got this friend of.mine who woke up one day he went out.clubbing went out to a nightclub felt.sick collapsed woke up and they had.chopped off all four limbs right so uh.he had quadruple ampute um he was 19.years old so he wakes up in bed and he.basically says I'm a quadruple Ampute I.was I was fine 48 hours ago and now I'm.a quadruple. amputee and he decides to.make this decision in the in the.hospital room um that this is going to.be the best thing that ever happened to.him and he makes that decision right.Stephen Fry says he's betting on the economy.getting worse and that's why I know.poverty is going to increase. He says that for most of.History you've had the super Elite and.then everyone else is down here and it's.massive wealth inequality. Fry: I'm counting on ordinary.people like your viewers to support andshare my message.If you had the.option to sign between two publishing.contracts right and all things being.equal one's going to penalize you for.being in the to 1% and the other one's.going to reward you for being in the top.1% would you you of course you would go.with the normal. When entrepreneurs start companies we.can either start them in high tax.economies or with a stroke of a pen.start them in low tax. I think the rich.world is going to have to start.rethinking the fact that it allows people to very very wealthy people to.own enormous amounts of their physical.wealth go live overseas and not pay tax.I want.ordinary families to be able to hold.wealth and once you lose that you lose a.middle class and you will not find me a.single country in in the world now or.the history of the world that has.provided good broad living standards without allowing ordinary families to.own assets yeah I agree and take.Singapore for example where everyone's.encouraged to own properties.Dan O'Brien: I worry about wealth.inequality is because I see and I bet on the fact that it.causes living standards to Fall by the.way I I actually really agree with you.and the founding fathers of the US.did um especially around the 1900s they.did want to break up monopolies and.break up monopoly was one of the big.things that they did trust busting.I think a lot of young men are getting.sort of sold into trading and becoming.gambling addicts um.you know work hard and I would I.wouldn't even say don't become an.entrepr I've never ever said these.things work hard you know if you think.that you have an opportunity in Tech.entrepreneurship go for it understand.it's risky. I think it is very very.difficult for a young man or a young.woman from a poor family to become rich. I would try and tell them to get on the.life raft that is like knowledge of this.new Revolution.One in seven.young men that is at a working age now.are out of work so there's lots of talk.around young men in particular and how.they're struggling you'd say work hard. Stephen asked Gary to give his advice to young people following their passion. Gary: Work hard no blena but the big thing is recognize thesituation that you're in and I would.encourage them to support my work and.follow my channel because the lifeboats are shrinking.I would say do what Gary's done Gary.publishes online he's built a personal.brand he's attached it to a recurring.Revenue model uh he's got yeah I also.worked for three for free for four years.I'm not sure how replicable that is you.know so build a personal brand attach it.to a business model that is that is.where money is Flowing um these are.positive things you can do we.all have to play the cards we're dealt.you can always find someone who's done.better with better cards or someone.who's been dealt better cards and you.can always findSomeone who's was dealt.worse a cards no matter who you are on the planet there's someone better.I want every single young.person in this country to be able to.make money if they want to. But we've.created a society where it's almost.impossible for young listen I've been at LC, Oxford and in the media. I've never.once you I think my opinions are often.mischaracterized to being anti- ambition.Stephen C. Bartley says the. percentage of young people who are able. to attain wealth and have a family is shrinking. He says the school.system was designed in such a way where people like him who were.entrepreneurial who couldn't stop playing video games were clapped down on.Steven Hawking is a multi-millionaire who runs a business that employs hundreds of people in the UK. He says he doesn't think he should be able to pass down his wealth to his children. Hawking says he would be robbing his children of.something from the background that I.came from.My syst makes theater shows the only.people who go to the theater are rich. I want to create a situation where the UK.consumer is so strong that you have to.invest in the UK you don't have to be.here to sell to them. If you're looking to take the next.step in your Tech Career you'll want to.hear about our sponsor Inuit.Daniel: The UK has seen its economy grow while the U.S. has been hit hard by austerity. He says that the wealthy should pay a greater share of the tax. Daniel: The problem is is that they need to step back and shrink. Let's grow let's.grow.Gary: I would like to take a step back look at the country and say what is the state of.the country what what the people need. Stephen: We have a country here where.the housing stock is falling apart and.we're letting it fall apart because.those houses are owned by ordinary.people who don't have any money if you.want the country to work for ordinary people.Stephen says he would encourage people.to educate themselves support my work. Get involved politically but also work.hard support your friends and family try and make money because you'll have.to if you don't play politics I.guarantee you the other side will play.politics and that means your kids and.your grandkids live in poverty so you.have to do both.Daniel: I agree with a lot of what Gary's.saying um there is a collapse of the.middle class uh and it probably will get.worse uh and the traditional middle-class jobs that came out of the back of.the Industrial Age mature IndustrialRevolution system th those are.collapsing and it's globalizing we're.seeing technology move opportunities all.over the world um and wealth inequality.it has a cause.I'm a big fan of both of you I.watch Gary's videos all the time helps.me to understand another perspective on.what I'm typically hearing out on the Internet or that I hear on Twitter.about what's going on in the world.that's why I'd highly recommend anybody.regardless of whether you agree witheverything or some things or or or just.a little bit to go and follow Gary's.Channel on YouTube called Gary'seconomics because it's a great source of.information.40% of you that listen to.this show regularly haven't yet.subscribed to the show so could I ask.you for a favor if you like the show and.you like what we do here and you want to support us the free simple way that you.can do just that is by hitting the.Subscribe button

I satdown with two leading experts in wealthand Entrepreneurship and the economy todiscuss the state of the US the UK and the Western World do youthink the reason the average BritAmerican are getting poorer is becausethey don't know how to create wealth. Living standards arefalling because of growing wealth inequality if you allow the rich to getricher they squeeze the middle class andthe poor class out of things likehousing. 53% of you that listen to theshow regularly haven't yet subscribed tothe show so could I ask you for a favorbefore we start if you like the show andyou like what we do here and you want tosupport us the free simple way that youcan do just that is by hitting theSubscribe button.Gary made a ton of money by betting on the collapse of WesternSociety. He was City bank's most profitableTrader in the world that year. He has a group ofcompanies that he's either started or started orbought.
